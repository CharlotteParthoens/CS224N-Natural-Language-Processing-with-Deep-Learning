You know that what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in America.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather clothes, and never no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell somewhere else.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a very complicated circle that I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the <unk> years in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
And when he was just shaking to bleed every week in the room of kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life for letting me walk into the room of the teachers.
I did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that fight against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night, I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we never get to know us.
You could be <unk> in Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've ever found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to ask you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it a place, and the <unk> and we get rid of their family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew about how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to give himself as an adult arrived at <unk> became an ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved her.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked about this today.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them up to my <unk> water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> per year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or break the barriers of ice.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment, and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up and hold it up to the end, while others can't afford it more, and they would be engaged in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, largely as we see ourselves, sometimes as humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As it melts a <unk> I'm breathing its ancestral atmosphere.
As an iceberg you melts it releases fresh water in minerals that feeds so many forms of life.
I come up and photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there exist in this way, and won't exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the life cycle.
Part of the ice of the <unk> <unk> is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you are from an iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's rare to get to see an <unk> iceberg in it.
There it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an <unk> iceberg on the average size.
<unk> water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so we put the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same moment, every single <unk> a baby.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want it to be too much in the details of conception, because if they stop to think about conception itself, I'm not going to pay for me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that in a case, the chromosome and of the sperm joins the X X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X X chromosome joins the X X chromosome.
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity on the ground floor I turned two roles.
In one of my roles -- I work with the history of anatomy.
I'm <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- that is to say, with human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids the idea of <unk> what have been thinking about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients, or as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with lots of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physics <unk> not fit into male sketches and conventional <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't exist in the male or female forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene of the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the life of <unk> <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks the testosterone, the body doesn't react to it.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but without the reaction.
As a result, the body develops in a typically female course.
When you look at the baby -- the baby looks like a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breast period, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when somebody realizes that something is happening.
After giving them tests they realize that instead of having ovaries, and <unk> actually has <unk> and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think about a man, but it's not really that way.
Women like the men, we have in the body something called areolar <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I think of a woman who has not known its <unk> structure, I think it will be a typical woman, most of women as I are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> syndrome.
That's why sex is complicated -- it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old boy who was born and raised like <unk> had <unk> and sex relationships with her, he was wearing a life as a kid, and he had just found out he had ovaries and womb.
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosomes, and in the uterus the areolar glands were so active that we essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a result, the <unk> were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone receptor typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it went to the age of 19, when he started having the secret problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> that is to say, they have <unk> <unk> wrapped in tissue.
We don't know exactly why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> they are <unk> surgeries that are not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why they are <unk> several surgeries that are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity -- to be black to say to have African anatomy in historical terms.
Very simplistic.
And when you give us a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture of <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic <unk>
Imagine how amazing it is to have kids that are born like two people within one body.
The most extreme case is last year in the past year with South African South African <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What do you test are going to do to determine whether you're <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you the reporters that there are no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature is not to plot a <unk> line between men and women and women and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who approach that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, the more we have to admit that these categories were extinct -- we were thinking of these categories -- they were <unk> directly with categories of <unk> <unk> are much more <unk> than we <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact that they <unk> from them in just a few <unk>
And as we moved in science to get more and more in a uncomfortable zone that we have to recognize that the categories of <unk> that are probably too much <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are fighting at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes <unk> and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today on day -- not in public, but I know inside the <unk> about when someone is dead.
Our ancestors have never had to get this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose and she was still not <unk>
If I stopped moving through it.
But today, we can, for example, extract organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma of really determine the death of someone. And this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics, I am progressive, making people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that he gets nervous.
And we would argue that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
It will be from the concept point of view.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fan of <unk> <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so sweeping in what they did, that I find myself every bit of seeing that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> were to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they were doing, was a <unk> concept and <unk> with another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as they all remember, what our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs from the old world didn't know about the DNA, but they had clear the right idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were the idea that it was coming up with political power to the right of blood passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the differences, that was very radical.
And they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And there's very clear, if you look at the story of the <unk> <unk> that many of them were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the definitive explanations and therefore it was <unk> the concept of being able to be passed from a vague idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of avoidance talks about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, we were passing the idea of the casual coincidence.
And in doing so, they were laid out the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think of that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then came the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights movement, saying, "I'm a man.
And again, people of color that I would get to <unk> <unk> about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking questions why we keep them any <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should look at the anatomy.
I don't want to say that in the age of five years, I should be allowed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me have sense, and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things that I think of the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before I time: the June 1 in June 1980.
So Henry, the other thing was born in term, was born the March 1 <unk>
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary were attributed all three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent -- the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> by the compulsory thing that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary. On the hand, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can be married in all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So there are still <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of the anatomy that could be <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we are going to make it <unk>
But a lot of people get caught in a strange position.
For instance, Texas has decided that to marry a man is not having to have <unk> and that to marry a woman you have <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't do tests that are <unk>
But this is also very strange because this story I told you at the beginning of the Yentl syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I love <unk> he offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea.
But in practice, how do you do that?
How do we judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I am not sure that we should be <unk> in this to <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social service than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and intelligent decisions about their sex relationships than I know.
So how do we put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very hard.
And a part of me ask what if the character of one person could in the future will be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
Do we really want to get that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to continue this current of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed, unless they are willing to have a change of sex, in which case it allows it to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm happy to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that he had done to give birth twins to then pick them up and so forth their fame.
But when the phone asked her to the point of the operation, I was looking at a very <unk> operation -- said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, he's considered the political company instead of the separation of <unk>
America offers tremendous possibilities to people to be who are not <unk> to change over the state.
So I think we have to be in the head.
Well, to finish up, I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be like, or as it could have been, if we had given greater participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
For years, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in finding the sex difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women on average, not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and concerned about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought I was interested in feminism <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what is the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking <unk> <unk> so there's nothing feminine in the <unk>
But the more I thought about the question, the more I think is something feminine on the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the feminine brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the parents were very aware of finding the way to protect people from the state, it's possible to have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we bring democracy beyond our <unk> to think less about the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So while we try to create a <unk> <unk> we think about what we do each other for others.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we're far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count on a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth much more than their construction cost.
So we could easily tell the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But they just kept off by buildings of apartments.
Imagine that half of the people who wanted to live in apartment are already owners and that in the other half it will still not get to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to make expansion by all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions that we can get from construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a completely new place, building a whole new apartment building completely new, always and when the rules of that place will grow up to the construction instead of getting <unk>
So I suggested that governments are <unk> new volumes of reform large enough to contain cities and gave them a name: cities.
Later I learned that roughly at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75,000 <unk> will come up from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> happened by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the following presidential elections -- <unk> <unk> we have a platform by which I promised and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked him to be his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a large number of testing with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say that you can't go and look at all the current residents of apartments.
It makes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies for <unk> and usually they are the rules that prevent us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a <unk> friend sent him to <unk> a link to the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They came to me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December in December we met in Miami, in a conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> where, in some cases, it's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was really very simple in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain.
So the president of <unk> was called, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to go to <unk> and talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport is covers over 100 kilometers away.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this sort of explaining it, that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be a choice of a city where you could go to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of kilometers away into the North.
And we also add new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries -- they could benefit from the countries that will help them to set up and make the norms of the <unk> so that everybody could trust that <unk> actually <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This photo is from there.
It could be easily about 1,000 square miles.
And so soon after the 19th of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow these special parts of development.
In a country that had just been going through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional constitutional <unk>
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice to Congress.
On February 17th, he passed another time on another voting of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting on the back, 21 to 24 of February, a shifting <unk> was to the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is being built in Korea -- is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after that was spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country is interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about it in practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow managers to die, and maybe it would allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the Supreme Court for this new justice system.
There is urban and builders, which are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that would like to come into the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately somewhere else.
There is a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family to get a job, sometimes they are unwed mothers who have to earn the money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it think about insisting so families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends, my friends were asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession to public and is that I live obsessed with outfits.
I love to find, and I love to photograph and publish and publish my blog and <unk> and different ones.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is <unk> of <unk> markets, and <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
<unk> <unk> allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people who are <unk> usually my money is going to a good <unk> My view is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my <unk>
I will like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I <unk>
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
<unk> inside a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that I would be able to find everything else that I wanted to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know as the woman walking at TED in <unk>  That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure not to use new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this tiger tiger
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always look at you over 50 dollars.
All of the <unk> including <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is power.
It's almost <unk> it's impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
You just know yourself.
If you fall out of the right people, not just <unk> you get <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you take in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to be <unk> or I remember their little seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good with something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your inside and outside, you don't look at you <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal <unk> and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and over again when people were approaching me this week, just what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, I am going to give everything.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to put certain things.
I don't need to do myself emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> and <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there is a little love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive side.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> from every single <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brains.
For example, this would be a completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not to be another <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that as most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logic to address these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them, and then we look like react. And then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that you can have developed over the years is the one that says that one thing can be only in one place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a small kid, and he didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet the playing with that bar of parking lot taught him a precious lesson, and it is that big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have the world, except you can be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking lot, play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics a few years ago; you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't really play with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, never nobody saw a <unk>
But they didn't fit well into my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all the principles of quantum mechanics in it.
I don't find the reason why I should not.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first thing you can see has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the little piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to expand it a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we do a good approach to the little metal <unk>
So what we see is a little bit of metal, a springboard shape, and that stands up on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip and put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> <unk> <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be in a elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of rare things, but then when other people go up to do those things, because I don't want to hurt you, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate things behave in the same way.
<unk> in the journey of inanimate objects are not just people -- it's also the light that we want, and the wind that goes on and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then we took a <unk> and we pulled out all the air, and then we put it to a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, by being just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as it.
So we measured its movements.
We found that they moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. and the way we were thinking about, was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving you a soft car, we were able to make it <unk> and that I don't know at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and they don't do it at the same time?
Let's think about the atoms.
In an example, every trillion of atoms that make that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It's the <unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is roughly the same than the difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, this is my piece of logical speech.
So imagine if you were in multiple places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you acting your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we got it, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator in fact are only quantum objects that are just quantum objects that are just going to fit into a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so <unk>
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head who's here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months to me.
And a lot of negotiations and stories, and I went to 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explaining to just this slide and this is a access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and going to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to do it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better than I show a demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we have done from their launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around all of the museums there.
There's the <unk> gallery <unk> the <unk> <unk> Van <unk>
In fact, I'm going to get into one of my favorites, when I was <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click on it, and we <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the plane, and with a single click, we jumped in.
You're inside, that you want to go to the end of the hall.
You're going to go ahead and go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the data from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get to 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
It can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to do it for you.
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this looks <unk>
I went and found that the kids were actually playing something.
And I talked about a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> on the Tuesday one Tuesday one.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get it even deeper in and you'll see that you really can get the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull out the picture, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best is to come, one second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump again at MoMA in New York City.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed it was to find details.
But what if you want to look at the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this piece of <unk>
It enhances it up and really it <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts of this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen this before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite function.
There's a lot more things here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you, all of you, no matter whether it's rich, or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can start online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple. Come on -- I've created this function that I call "The Power of <unk> -- we just made a zooming around you.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery in London.
You can write things -- I send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel like contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all of the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my view, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to your work of art and that is represented properly online.
And the big question that I'm doing today is this: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think about it is a <unk> pixel pixel ...
In our lab we call this sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am <unk> Italian all kids in Italy are growing up with this photo on the wall of their bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something really interesting about race racing one in the last two decades.
So some time ago, if you wanted to win a career for annual one, and take a budget and take it to a good car, and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot and the pilot and the pilot were good enough, you made the race.
This is what it is, in engineering, we have real time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics.
They're turning computers in the air.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is something big.
As a few other wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are coming into our everyday objects together.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> at <unk> during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
And in a way, it's like almost all of the atoms that are available to be <unk> and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that the hammer took the hammer and threw it up to the Moses -- they actually can still see a <unk> <unk> and said <unk> <unk> non <unk> and he said, <unk> non <unk> and what don't <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm just going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something out.
Let's start with this.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer hopefully over 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of you remember, they were in Italy in Italy and France, and at the end of the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, he won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the Athabasca River.
It's morning, before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
By the afternoon, early there are people standing here and doing <unk>
It starts by the silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, <unk>
They all went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day they were in the center of the winning team and the prime minister back then.
And then everybody went down.
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the time <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we could not have done just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but of things that we use and use.
Today we know everything about the source of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a <unk> how do you get?
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
And then we put a little chip on a little chip, a label and then we started <unk>
These are the results.
I went from <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that before not existed.
They're happening very complicated things, and there's lots of need.
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we dropped out is not yet somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we put on a day still is still there.
That if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is to push over the environment.
And the first project is something that we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all began with a question from the mayor of the city, which came to us and told us that Spain and southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of use in public space in the architecture.
And the question was, how can the technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was imagine that you have a <unk> and the valves of the <unk> <unk> you open and <unk>
It was created like a water water, with water pixels with water.
If you fall down the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, images.
And by <unk> the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked a lot.
And we had an commission to design the entrance to the entrance to the <unk>
We call it a <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no windows and no windows, but when you come up with it opens up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you lower your roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture is disappears as in this case.
And those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture away.
This is working.
You see the people who are going on the inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> by testing the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way of interacting had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you go to it, but a building that was still making cuts and holes in water, and you had to jump up for <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the water pixels and projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that you could have small helicopters in the air, and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving into space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one that we saw before, which moves with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud, to form.
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal display in two dimensions.
Or it's normal, but in three dimensions, where what it changes is light, not the position of the pixel position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears on different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D <unk> to the one that you can get anywhere near and put it up and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light lights up, you see this thing that we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of <unk> today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use it as an entrance to <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> look at the <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time like motion capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and motion and motion with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our <unk> environment as an nursery of <unk> like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of us <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what's remarkable that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've got everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world, the power of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions. How do we move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in the collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but on the pixels.
You can move around and have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve to share the main moments of the Olympics in 2012, and even more, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are <unk>
Suppose I told you that, with only some changes in their genes, they could make better <unk> more accurate and faster.
Or you might like to be in better ways, to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure for ourselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe those people who were always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do you bring creativity?
Hands up. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you want memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel pretty well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just imagination?
Or maybe it is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> topic here at the TED Conference.
The great Vice <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay titled "Nothing in biology makes sense of <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution, this is just about the past, or the future?
Does it matter to each other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one point is, of course, the most interest we are.
<unk> from a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There have been maybe 20  25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk>
It might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells -- is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human resistance that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it is the same protein, and that is chemically <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the gut more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think of -- when Antonio <unk> asked them from <unk> you think about <unk>
And the gut is a beautifully egalitarian environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that you can want to have no effort out of their own.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria to the occasional pie, you rush to the output.
But for that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what do we tell about the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it <unk>
When I just went to college, I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental about most of the existence of life, in organisms that are just divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two of these <unk>
But when organisms appear -- things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something really important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the body of the body comes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits your door of a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him, you find a little slight <unk>
He looks at it and says, <unk> it for a <unk> <unk>
He is doing great. "I will pick the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of the <unk> not necessarily only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to stay healthy.
I wanted to restore health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about spending genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are kind of as sensing rockets designed to send the genetic load on the next level, and then let us go to the sea.
I think they all <unk> the feeling that expressed Allen when he said, "I don't want to accomplish the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily favors longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favors the biggest or the stronger or faster and even more clever.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that we would find out if there would be fish there, fish, in the void, however, have managed to make that an informal environment.
So what does this mean that when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look at the <unk> phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and written from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we can adapt to us as well as we adapt to us.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> us so that it's no longer possible to have the necessary power for that evolution.
A second possibility is that we create an evolution of the traditional kind of natural, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> when the species <unk> planets are going to exist the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce biological evolution.
But there's a third possibility, a intriguing and intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what it chooses to be individual and familiar level.
Think of them also that if we could choose not only to be able to choose not only the sex of its <unk> but in its own body to make genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
In 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a cost of 20,000 and a week.
It didn't make a lot of them so that the human genome is actually going to be <unk> and getting more and more to the reach of all.
So these changes.
The same technology that has produced human resistance in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect them, but they're going to induce against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine industry in plant cells from a plant plant.
Can you imagine something nice that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just two other little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies, but if you could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes -- reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then that same analytical engine technology that can produce the changes of the science that can produce the changes to prevent disease is going to enable us to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't we have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you were able to stick it with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't we have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions to pass this together to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can go to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are the choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have in front of them.
We're going to use these options on a <unk> a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, more and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what you might do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 high school high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> That sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a seat only that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably have a few <unk>
The pilot already had <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot would run into the Hudson River.
Often that's not the road.
<unk> the engines.
Imagine being on a plane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words that have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all of the people who wanted to come in, and I didn't know, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
While I thought about that later on, I was a phrase, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll set it up.
I don't want to tell you anything in life.
And that urgency, that really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is while I <unk> the George Washington, which was not for a lot -- I thought about wow, wow, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and with my mistakes, I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity also giving place to my ego.
And I'm <unk> the time that you would take on things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, like <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please get <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, wow, die is not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And the <unk> <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids growing.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  And I scream, <unk> as a kid.
And for me, that was all the reason to be the world.
At that point, I got to connect those two points that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
It gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And it gave me another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and please not be that -- but imagine, and how do you get it?
What is it that <unk> who are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live forever.
How do you change your relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're being the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many different projects.
But the most great thing I worked on was this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the world's most important <unk>
One day he came home to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
<unk> today has total <unk>
It can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, and of course, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, not that you have seen Stephen <unk> it's not that all the people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be important and have a good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable to people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Somebody to see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they communicate with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I was presented with the only desire to get a check and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I teamed up with his brother and his father there at that very precise time, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony goes to speak, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to turn it back again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much on your inner can't be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research Research -- which have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer and draw it and draw the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the attacks and Bush and ultimately, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot to move things next to another we'd achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of the insurance companies, and we got a machine so that you could make a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was the other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the world of <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and that when I was born, they would have removed the frames of the walls and instead there would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we were going to go to the <unk> journey, my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a couple of <unk> sun that we bought in the <unk> walk of <unk> <unk> some copper wire.
We took a camera on the <unk> we put it into an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- which is <unk> which is <unk> we published the source code, the software is low for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company that I say.
There are no hospital that I can say, "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we came back to the <unk> room.
I love this photo because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming all night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall in the outside of the hospital.
And he came back to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to disrupt in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and would take me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
It is our <unk> <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
That's why we're trying to figure out how to fix it, and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all sorts of recognition.
We have gained many prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 greatest inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
Best of all of this -- and this is what ends the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in downtown Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of the urban art <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that isn't possible, do it possible.
Nothing in this room is possible -- the stage, the stage, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything like this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology I simply recognized something and I would relate to some wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not now, when? And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you, guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations very difficult and at the same time as much dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in hot and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days by eating just a little bit fun at first, a difficult thing in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in large part of my career, I've been <unk> in situations in horrible ways, with the only goal to try to look at social questions in ways that we have to be involved with interesting, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that you see entertaining and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I was coming here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered to sell the rights of my TEDTalk TEDTalk in 2011.
What had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content I could do it in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said this, it's a very good chance of <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you would have asked me a year ago, I couldn't have <unk>
But in the new film that I'm working on -- we looked at the world of marketing, <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've gotten into horrible situations over the last few years, but nothing could tell me anything that was so difficult to be so dangerous and so dangerous how to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is trying to make the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> from products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The biggest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom, in beginning to end, it has images of brand, all the time, from the <unk> which appears before the title -- the <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is exploring this whole idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the brand in the title, but we're going to make sure we grow up all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe I would take a shoe and get the most cool shoe you <unk>
The greatest car that you've driven in "The largest movie ever, ever <unk> the best <unk> you have from "The largest movie <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you the brands as part of life, make them <unk> <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The <unk> goal is transparency.
You'll see all the process in this film.
That's the complete idea, everything the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how much <unk> is going to be the people there.
<unk> You've got a <unk> -- I don't know if you're going to get a lot of it, but you know how it is going to be <unk> David <unk> David <unk> How much money does it take to do this?
MS: One and a half and a half and a half million -- so <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard for the meeting with them, but certainly is going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands in it.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to come up with us as a whole bunch of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> by the film or for me.
JK: Both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought we had a <unk> meant we have a microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappear.
No want to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And he was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, it was to present the product to so many people as possible, to make so many people see him as possible.
Especially in the world today is this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of the separate media -- it's not the idea to be able to tell that new vehicle is worth going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, there was not such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this picture.
See, when you search for <unk> images on Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: the <unk> free of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility or information, especially in <unk> practices.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians the <unk> President <unk> even <unk> <unk>
But all of a sudden, when it comes to making it really change <unk>
But why? Well, transparency da <unk>   like that weird bear that is still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
It was a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell them that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want a story, but that we want to make a story, story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there he is looking at me as I used to myself, say, "Son, there's three sides in history.
There's your story, there's my story, and there's <unk> story.
You see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to go out and go to the <unk> and go to the businesses myself with all my team.
So what I began to figure out suddenly -- and what I started to give me is that when you start talking to you with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have my friends who make big, big, giant movies -- and others who do small movies like my own.
And my friends who make movies of big <unk> say that the reason their movies have so much success is because the brands are associated with the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, movies <unk>
And the movie is called "The biggest movie never <unk>
How are we going to look specifically at the movie?
Every time I go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you fine for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you get to you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there he would offer you one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> will have their opportunity.
We're going to have both of them for man to make the solid <unk> to <unk> on the bar, whatever.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen <unk> We're a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind us <unk> people are the reason why this interest us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: Technology higher.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something great? <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do you keep you fresh more time? We better <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common?
I need to talk to the <unk> to people like me, to the <unk> <unk>
They have to talk to me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like <unk>
Woman: revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
And I like a lot of the dark colors, a lot of gray colors.
Usually I'm wearing sunglasses, as sunglasses, or I like the <unk> and the like.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: It's partly <unk> partly in part <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I am the pet guy.
<unk> toys in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my <unk>
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx <unk> because I was holding the <unk>
Man 5: Go! <unk> failed.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm <unk> <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be a brand -- Tom, but I often woke up at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could get into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> of <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first photo is a familiar picture.
A: <unk> a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings you are.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk> from that world.
MS: That's the world -- I think your world is the world that we want, like people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live in your life, the work you do.
All of those things come and start in a place and start in a place and in my case, and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be.
I like different things.
I like weird things, I like weird things.
A: <unk> from the <unk> to what do you do?
What's the <unk> How phase of <unk> you find right now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Let's get a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You have to be scary. What kind of roller coaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: thank you for your patience. <unk> Great <unk> Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yes, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness on all this.
<unk>
It was very well <unk> together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that some companies just <unk> in one of their strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's nature that we have to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those elements and you actually give them to support and make them become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> and brands conscious, those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS:
If someone asks you to <unk> your brand, your brand, your brand, what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute that makes the blood <unk>
Or are you more a <unk> attribute of it.
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful as it will be cool like the <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold like <unk> <unk> fast or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical as <unk>
Or are you more of the attribute of <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're reliable, <unk> familiar -- reliable, sacred <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this movie we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the end product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they now use MRI MRI to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing as a movie for film.
We went to San Paulo where they've banned advertising in the air.
In the entire city over the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no wall, no <unk> nothing.
And we went to school districts in which companies are getting way into the schools of money on the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the biggest answer or where I've been more successful is the ones that I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think of the people, who will challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? <unk>
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This takes only a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no television.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad, because most of the agencies that we talked about, we loved their clients not to be a part.
I have always believed that if you are <unk> if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get out to the people that are pushing them to fail.
I think that when you train your employees at risk <unk> it's preparing your whole company to be at a bit of rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities they can <unk>
Ultimately, we go forward, I think we have to give it a place to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear of fear. <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
More than ever a bit of honesty is going to travel a long way.
And I said, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk -- <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who are in <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, I would have a name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check out of the organization, the TED matrix -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my TED aid for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset in order to develop nuclear weapons is <unk> <unk> plant in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we were able to compromise these systems that controlled speeds and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a cash virus out of Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
<unk> enter the gray, gray, damages <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started doing research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that was known is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> <unk> <unk> multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these <unk> systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where you infect our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they went very strange things.
<unk> was <unk> as a lab rat lab who didn't like our <unk> but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "That's a <unk> attack?
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is looking for actively <unk> if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect is actually working on that place:
If not, you don't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could be, say, for example, a power plant in the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
better than you get the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the open-source code, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They would take all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much the operator.
So you know it.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, high-tech, let me tell you, the load is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15 lines of code.
It looks like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking at initially were calls in the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to try and do with the real world, with potential opportunities in the real world.
We need theories about recipients that can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a giant valuable, and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infection has been <unk>
There are many thousands of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and to <unk> <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I asked them in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to do it slow, and <unk> in an obvious <unk> effort to make the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the digital digital <unk> looking very close to data and structures.
So for example, the number <unk> shows up in that code, you can't be <unk>
I started researching scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
It was almost <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
So it wasn't like this:
The results have been out of a variety of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
Yet we discovered that both of both digital <unk> were going to one and same goal, but from different <unk>
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other targets are driven by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- I really got <unk>
There's the gray box, and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the input of the sensors for example, from the sensors of pressure and the colored sensors and provide code, which is still running during the attack with false data <unk>
And believe it or not, this false entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed by <unk> video.
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine goes down, you have to open the valves of escape into a <unk>
Obviously this can't do it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And neither the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares that.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> <unk>
It could also be also, for example, in a power plant, or in an automotive factory plant.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this load with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
It would be as possible.
And if you look at that, with what <unk> is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals are not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All of the green areas are a large number of goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and better than we start to do right now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower thing.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can carry out and give <unk> skills or someone that makes users of wheelchair raise them and go back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are not different from something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force, and it increases its speed, and help you, for example, how to handle balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now in what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, have to carry on their back a <unk> <unk> and it's got to be <unk> to bring even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, at 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic chronic damage.
So we decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help run the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton -- <unk> I can rotate by 90 kilos of variables for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run <unk> <unk>
And what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
So it's a reality.
So let me go back to the users of the wheelchair, which I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in the wheelchair, around the world.
Like one percent of the population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often with a very young person, with damage to the spinal cord that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years, <unk> against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that is getting it divided quickly.
Its only option, many times -- for a brain injury, or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I must recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who is 19 years ago in the neocortical column, and as a result could not go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors.
It was completely not in the crutches and they send signals to the onboard laptop, here on the back.
There are some batteries that give the motors on the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move through this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, by a stranger in the air, skiing down the bottom.
In a fraction of the second, I lost all feeling and all moved from turning it down.
Shortly after, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you'll never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
And so I stole up to the last sense of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs the <unk> to scale rocks and even ride on a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the future of future generations, not just of soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of chairs of wheelchair, everybody.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, I know all of his cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos of the forests of Congo.
The bonobos are along with the chimpanzees, their closest living relatives
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known by their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large guys, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where deadly violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of big apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest, and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been moved by decades and caused nearly as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger of the Bonobo.
The hunting of hunting and deforestation is doing it not to fill in a stadium with the bonobos that get in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear laughter hidden by the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes <unk> the love, not the <unk> because they have endless sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity -- because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans as humans, they love to play throughout their life.
Play is not just a child's game.
For us, and for the game is fundamental to establish links and foster <unk>
With him we learn <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors -- diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo sees the roots of the laughter, the dance and the dance and the human perspective.
The game is the glue that comes to us.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> ball, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I just think that in this case, I love it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common as much as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because we put this video really interesting because it shows the invention of unusual unusual elements -- like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and promotes the <unk> and at the same time it's more fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> you can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with a little bit of water with it.
I think that, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we formed are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future that we have to adapt to a more difficult world with greater and more difficult and greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> <unk>
In order to adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But, you know, at the maximum our game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When you look at least appropriate to play, you can be the moments in which it's the most urgent thing.
So you know, fellow primates, let's take this gift of evolution and <unk> together while we <unk> creativity, the friendship and the wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of a <unk> <unk>
And in our city, where the volunteers are coming to a highly skilled personnel -- you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so he had a pretty high probability to go.
But still, there was a race standing against the other volunteers to get to the captain to get the captain to go to the office and figure out what our task was.
When I met the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly has been through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at night, and she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just gotten before I was -- <unk> <unk> <unk> came up to the captain and he asked him to come back and save the dog <unk> dog.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money which, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I walked into a burning building to save a live alive just because I made it for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and let me get this woman a pair of shoes."
We <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the firemen <unk> that at that height and less had finished off the fire and entered the fourth room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking about, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load on the staircase and I met my <unk> and the precious dog on the front door.
We got out of the house <unk> for the owner of the house where, as I was to expect, and it got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the <unk> <unk> letter for the brave <unk> effort to save her home.
And the kindness that she looked at was that somebody had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a volunteer fireman I witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage to individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So, when I look at this room to people who have succeeded, or they're doing remarkable levels of success -- I'd like to remind you this:
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you get right now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a <unk> park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's lives, but each day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So you enter the <unk> <unk> my shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block there.
The first concrete blocks developed in <unk> with a very simple idea: modules of a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the building unit more used in the world.
They have allowed us to build larger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
And he was called <unk>
And in a few years, the brick bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that you've made more than 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or buildings or home.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block of the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> we piled on some other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to create much larger circuits and more complex, a brick at once.
But there is a difference. The transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't know what the building blocks of our time is reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of bringing engineers into the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each one with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, and motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they join these magnets.
So you can't put them in a wrong way.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the <unk> blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green one, and very quickly, you can start making bigger circuits.
A blue with a green with a green one produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to be connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures, very simple.
To make <unk> faster or slower -- you just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection of growing.
We want all the interactions in the world to come together to brick brick to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, it all must be accessible.
We've given <unk> to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how it works a light at night, or why the door of an elevator is kept open or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've been pushed back to the design schools.
So, for example, designers without any experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of Rhode Island School who have no experience in engineering, only wood wood and paper and said, Do something like something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, an <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of the darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of it.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So let's go ahead and make up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is seeking to get involved in the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
We are able to continue the next to one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
<unk> is ...
Oh, I mean, I do the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, and we asked them to work on government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and would be like <unk> <unk>
We had a few members every year, and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World we send them to the wild world.
They did big <unk> worked with employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
So meet <unk>
This is a hydrant hydrant in Boston.
So here it looks like if I would go to a quote, but what really looks for is that somebody else is going to be caught when it is caught by snow because he knows it's not very good by putting out the fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did he get to ask for help in this <unk> fashion.
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment -- I was very much <unk> last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
Is it really nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You accepts <unk> when you go back.
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't, someone can be <unk>
So you have a computer uprising.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications -- last year.
But something else does that no other technology in the U.S. government.
And it spreads <unk>
A responsible for systems of <unk> City to see this app realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to get a <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people <unk> the batteries.
That's why he asks the citizens of <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just was throwing it up to make people <unk> to clean up sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that plan using it.
And this has spread out of <unk> in organic and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know this isn't normally happening.
The software acquisition typically takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two months and a half.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then we told us that the normal canals would have taken at least two years and side about two million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there is a project in the power of California that even the time has 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
And so an application that shows in a couple of days, and it was spreads in viral way is a kind of warning shot to the institution of government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not like in private enterprises, as a lot of people think that it should be.
It's also not like a technological company, but rather than the Internet itself.
That is, without <unk> in open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents a way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a problem of collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out that we're really good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we would connect together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given up with the government.
Can you feel a lot of frustration before that, but they don't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that make us crazy -- the government is essentially in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together is because he alone didn't work.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing.
Politics didn't change the government.
And given that the government in the last instance made away from -- remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way of thinking will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to pick people out of people who are <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of health care and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark sustainability in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
He joined <unk> in the official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open up the gates of the house, put it very strong and see if you're <unk>
And it worked. So it worked.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston has no call center.
It has a application, and a mobile phone, called <unk> <unk>
You don't get that app.
It was the work of very clever people from the Bureau of New York City <unk>
And one day, this actually actually gets this <unk> <unk> in my cube trash.
How do I do to <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I'm <unk> I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. He went home.
Good evening <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to <unk> collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to join and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
They connected the two people.
And it could be connected to the government services that we need but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When a neighbor helps another, <unk> the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think that one is the input of the other.
Our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have I chosen a <unk> <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government is changing our values and we get our needs, and then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface of 15 <unk>
It's below what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> that keeps that that it belongs to us that we financed as something that we operate on our against, that other thing, and we are losing power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy out of it.
Because this is where the real government of governance.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of governance.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have <unk>
This is a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the request of the financial reform.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for those of us that we have faced with government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to look at the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the function of government so that it can be expanded to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is about 28 years old -- so I have a generation older than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to speak, everybody's going to talk.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and do it.
So when they face the government problem doesn't really care about getting their voices.
They're using their hands.
They put hands to the work to program applications that make better work better.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning a fire hydrant, taking out <unk> getting a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> inside.
We were always able to have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to be able to fix the government until they don't forget the citizenship.
So I want to ask all the people here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will be a crowd of your hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in jails and prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulation has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that say here have impact around the world.
In occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
So here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a professor can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the right, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional American family dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was tough it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents born in slavery in Virginia Tech.
She was born about <unk> and his experience with slavery and <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was <unk> but she was also <unk>
When I was little, and I looked at it, she was approaching me and I gave myself a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then I was <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back and said, <unk> I still feel my <unk>
And if I told him no, I was going back again, and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that I would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of the 10.
In occasion, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture his time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, and I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I initially thought it was a game.
And so I looked at her and I looked and smile, but she was very serious.
And after 15 to 20 minutes, she got up, went up, went through the room, and he said, "Come on, <unk> both.
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say <unk>
I said, "Okay, let's <unk>
She said, "Now I <unk> I don't know, I said, <unk>
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Only I want you to give me three things: <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
Like I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I'll do it."
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to talk about is that you will always do the right thing, even though the right thing is it?
I thought and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I'll do that."
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to talk about is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I'll do it."
I grew up in the field, in South <unk> I have a brother a year older and a sister.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a pack of six beers, I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and me and went to the forest.
We hardly get the <unk>
He took a drink of beer, he gave my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's good. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> Today, you know, and you always do the same thing as we do.
I took something, your sister as well. Take a <unk>
I said, "No. I wasn't going to feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And I landed on the face with strength and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren who are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this thinking that it's a <unk> I'm saying that by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to everybody else that really doesn't make any sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My guys died of age-related diseases with alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million today.
In America, we have the biggest rate of <unk>
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration, in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities or black, it's so much despair.
One of three black men in the age of 18 and 30 years is in prison, or in parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore -- 50 to 60 percent of all young people of color are in prison or freedom of parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth which affects the results of the results.
And it seems to us very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not any problems.
We're straight.
I find it interesting.
We're looking at our work -- some of which really curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as other states will be <unk> for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years, the loss of loss of rights will be so high as it was before you put the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where she comes to 13-year-old children to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for kids, without any chance of getting done.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people on death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense, they have forced us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not to decide whether people deserve to die by <unk> crimes that if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the United States is defined by mistake.
Out of nine people who have been identified -- one that's innocent who is innocent and liberated from death row.
A mistake, <unk> an innocent from every nine.
This is interesting.
It would not be allowed to be allowed to fly planes if every nine that would come in, you would have from <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve killing.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> history, I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was an defined time by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
Now there are people older people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach talks, does you teach people to stop saying that in our history, for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> that we grew up with that."
The state of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic where we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we have to do with each other.
We're constantly creating tensions and conflict.
We have work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understand that they couldn't overcome <unk> without a compromise with truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany teaching death penalty conferences of death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers just stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's OK worrying about what you <unk>
<unk> we have no death penalty in Germany.
<unk> we will never have it here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There's no way that we have to be our story, we can never get into systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational than we <unk> and <unk> we were <unk> to <unk>
Let's go on about this.
How would we feel that in a world where a nation like Germany, we were born to people, especially if they were in their <unk>
We could not be <unk>
That would be <unk>
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult issues, the positive things and amazing things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology -- <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are driven by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate both of these things.
lately recently, we talk about the need to have more hope, more engagement, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the people who never come to TED.
And thinking about them is, in a way, something that is inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual, <unk>
With innovation with innovation, development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas -- also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us to look at not just as brilliant and <unk> but also in dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, an will for being in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think still in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There's no disconnect related to technology and design, that allows us to be truly human enough if we don't pay enough attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity, than if we're ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the big privilege, being a very young lawyer from meeting Rosa Rosa
These women would get together just to talk.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> told me to go, <unk> comes the Mrs. <unk> Are we going to get together to talk about.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "Yes, lady. Be <unk>
So she said, "Well, what do you do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, I'm going to make me show you this idea of justice justice.
<unk> what you're trying to do."
And I began to give it my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to be <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the <unk> of life, no freedom to be <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in the prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave him all my best speech and finally he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was going to get rid of them, and they were exhausted, very <unk>
At that time, Mrs. Alisch put my finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find a way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk>
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is higher to the worst thing we've ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't blame you, it's not a <unk>
Even, if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity of people who have to be <unk> by the law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and, surely, in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
It's not.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> <unk> we don't know about our technology, for our designs, not by our intellectual capacity or rational.
By the end of a society, not the character of a society, not the way they treat rich rich and powerful people, but in the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound topics about what we are.
And sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison and I see my clients at 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were being taught as adults as adults as adults.
And I start to think, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to somebody in what isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
So one night too late I was awake <unk> by God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't are, should have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> client -- a tiny, poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> so my black client was 14 to be treated like a <unk> <unk> CEO of a <unk>
In <unk> I got there that there had been active behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there is no ethical and a lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> but he had sent it to court.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> God. I have to go to court for this case, stupid.
I got up the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the court.
When he looked at me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
And so I got <unk> and <unk>
And I would lie in the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That's deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When the judge arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk>
People started to reach. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
The policemen arrived, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people who were mad at, because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I went to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look down the window and send it all that <unk>
I kept walking over here and for there.
Finally, this old black, with a head of worry, walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge is <unk>
So during the break a <unk> <unk> I was <unk> because the <unk> had come into the room.
And the assistant.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood up, I looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> this <unk> <unk> to tell this young woman who will keep his view in the <unk> target.
I've come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we can't truly be human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is connected to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity has to go to the <unk> of <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, of this community, to help you do something.
Something that's not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are various opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you will do an effort to improve the funding that you spend today in policies of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And in spite of this, the <unk> of the cases of homicide in homicide in <unk>
<unk> don't get anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to get these funds to get the law, for security.
I think there is a very <unk> opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it is that it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to the people who think this is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of crime with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes of violence.
It's the wrong war on Drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the U.S. population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into the supply chain, to steal a bicycle, for small crimes of <unk> instead of making those resources out of their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've been excited about here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> So these are just some of the clips I got in the last six months <unk> could be the last six days or for the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day, our senses receive many, many more data than the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters more to survive, the first stop of all of that data is an old clip of the temporal lobe called the amygdala.
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us damage.
And so from a <unk> stories of <unk> <unk> looking at them.
That old adage of the <unk> "If there's blood -- it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us bad news about seven days of a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be <unk>
But maybe it's not that way.
Maybe, in return, what really happens is we get <unk>
Maybe the enormous progress that was done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the extinction of species, and we have no doubts that we have.
As human beings are really good at <unk> the problems and the long time, we just with them.
<unk> then happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income income for inflation has been <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Also, the cost of food food, of transportation and transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful era in human history.
And Charles Vienna, that global literacy happened 25 to more than 80 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget.
And we continue to deliver higher expectations getting higher.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., much of the people who live under the poverty line has electricity, water refrigerators refrigerators -- air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet would never have dreamed of <unk>
It makes a lot of this technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price of about 12 to 24 months.
And so the smartphone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and 1,000 times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time, in war and peace, in recession in depression and rise.
It's the speed of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before any of the great challenges.
And although it's <unk> in a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, the robotics, and its ability to democratize personalized production all over the planet, synthetic biology, all the fuels and food, the digital medicine and the A.I. is digital, the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory in "Jeopardy" of Watson, <unk>
It was spade.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline than I <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
He plays with the subtle human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence on the cloud, available for all on your cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service or service that may positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
We can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean to create life for each <unk> for each <unk> it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that it's little little and making it <unk>
You see, the scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of <unk> <unk> <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
I went to dinner the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with covered in silver, and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth more than the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the <unk> to Washington is of aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's tied up by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum thing as cheap as we used it as if it was <unk>
It would take this analogy into the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet -- we are <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> every 88 minutes.
It is not about unregulated but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the <unk> of <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of America, solar electricity will cost six cents per hour compared to 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
You remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager spacecraft on Earth, in 1990, after the country happened.
<unk> a famous photo -- how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, water is ice, and we fought for the world's water <unk> but there is an hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the innovators would like to share with you, I would like to share with you, he gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator.
It's able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water at any source of any source -- saltwater, saltwater, water -- for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coke just thought that I'm going to do a major test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out, and I get confidence in that that will be, Coke will implement it globally in <unk> countries on the planet.
So this is an amazing innovation, because of this technology that we today exists.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration of cell phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that mightiest warrior has better mobile communication in the middle of Kenya that the Reagan was 25 years ago.
And if you have a smart smartphone with Google has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton does 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> video libraries of books and music, diagnostic technology -- now they get <unk> and lost market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best comes to the time of the health app there.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce the Foundation, which is something called the X X Prize, which was called the X <unk>
We're challenging the teams of the world to build these technologies into a mobile device with which they talk, and because it has <unk> they can be extracted from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses that a robotic medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are healthcare workers.
So when this device is called a RNA or DNA or DNA that would not be able to call the health care and first of all, to prevent the pandemic happening.
But this is the greatest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the one billion increasing.
The white lines here are the population.
We just spent the brand seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world health and health and health world.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we'll go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds we have never before <unk> that add to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars <unk> in the global economy.
And <unk> from more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education, the Khan Academy of the Khan Academy and because of using 3D prints and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the assumptions wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and be able to act for the first time?
So what do we find?
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing that I learned with the X X Prize, is that teams guided by his passion with a sense of of course you can do things -- things that were only allowed to do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to conclude by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you have heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the <unk>
It's something very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this teachers, university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined up and started <unk>
And it's been shown that today the recognition machinery of human patterns is better <unk> proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that today we have more power to take on the big challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion of the new minds that we were interested in to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of a few other extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I will give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they thought that we were <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It was actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught him so much to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cloud <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying one water in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
It burned so much with the sun and he was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The <unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, about forest mangroves.
There was a <unk> of about 20 inches, the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and it was going on for a good moment, so he was getting more than half in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went to the five centimeters tall.
It takes a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In some ways, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of deep-sea fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
So fishing development was meant to impose countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat. And this boat is called the <unk> four.
I went out to fishing in it, and we ran studies in southern China <unk> and, above all, in the Aral Sea.
What we capture out was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny little <unk> the tiny little bit of <unk> the remains of the coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishery coming out.
The background is going to be a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
Once we capture a alive.
He still wasn't <unk>
And so they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains, is what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But there's no <unk> left.
We don't remember it.
<unk> the starting point at the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the y-axis we have things -- biodiversity, number of the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation using images to use the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and it extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive the loss.
But they don't see the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of the end to keep the <unk> <unk>
And that, in great extent, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer they are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies have been killed, they kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before you <unk> it is unusual.
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focused on the big animals, and in an synonymous sea of large fish.
They become rare because the <unk>
Over time, there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do because evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they expect that to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of you have done as a captain such as a captain just just looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used -- or usually they don't use the <unk> scientists and because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies because they don't trust the sources of the past.
Out of the enormous paper that can accomplish a protected marine area.
Because with marine protected areas, we actually recreating recreating the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive because the starting point has been run and is extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine zone, and they can benefit from the vision that we <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Middle East, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may be actually <unk> the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the harbor bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the Islands and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about it, you think why people were being touched by the movie of <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do you <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is <unk> <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and look at YouTube videos.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are doing viral and what importance is that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that looked like something very, very difficult.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
You go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, only a small percentage gets a lot of hits and it gains cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: Three things: <unk> communities of participation and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video filmed outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the popularity of popular summer.
He was not proposed to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share an rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that we would give the video to the popular.
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> brings us new things and interesting them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday Friday. You have to start on Friday.  Everybody wants to reach a week, the weekend of a week --      -- I would not think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> from Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
And just like <unk> you'll see this video seemed to have come out of the nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, I was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday morning.
Well, he took it <unk> and lots of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of creators will embrace a point of view and share it with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this big internal joke then starts talking about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment entertainment of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon -- or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with an <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year, you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that that's rare, to know that there is a third of three hours that has seen four million times.
Even cats saw this video.
And there are cats that you saw other cats seeing the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version of the ancient one.
And then he became an international state.
Suddenly a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we all can form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> -- or created, Black or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written that <unk> this situation?
In a world where two days of video goes up by minute, just the single one and unexpected can tell us the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me I had to see this great clip of a kind that <unk> against <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit, I wasn't interested in too much.
Casey <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but often there are obstacles that you prevent you circular in the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> I found that five million people saw and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new approach to all the new thing that we do.
And all of this leads us to a big <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators for trend, creative communities participation, the totally unexpected, is characteristics of a new kind of media -- of a new kind of media, a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of wonder.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
I don't borrow permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all kind of a <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media features that are just the current media, but they were <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the unique unit of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> facing the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long, friends, now <unk>
They become silent.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was tried to <unk> but I <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> It reaches into the sea.
My mother, <unk> had only 18 years when his father died, and a marriage marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been meant to a task called the escape from her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> which challenges the fiction, a boat slid into the sea was dressed by flying ship.
Every adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear of them was for deforestation and death.
As most of the adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were <unk> we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the steady rhythm of the motor, the <unk> diving in every single <unk> and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came up several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to pluck for six hours.
But I can remember the lights out of the platform behind the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, just end the journey was too much for it; and the first apple I did, because of the men of the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
And after three months in a refugee camp, we were <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women in three generations making a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> suburb whose population is comprised of immigrants from immigration.
Unlike the middle class in the middle class -- whose existence <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the shops were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English fragments -- among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked on farms, and then on a computer assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk> from <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, it wouldn't matter what you ought to do, which was usually <unk>
Two pairs of middle school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because he had to last six years.
And there was <unk> and <unk> about <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home.
At home, where?
Something happened to be <unk>
It was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were excited about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother suffered <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was to be wakes up until your nightmares are actually going to be able to make it <unk>
She opened up a computer store, then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women came up with their stories about men who couldn't make <unk> angry and <unk> and <unk> boys in between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
They were created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> <unk> <unk> with what I <unk> from myself.
In the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically, <unk> by violence, abuse of drugs and isolation.
But many were given help over the years.
And because of that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyers, I chose the Australian young of the year.
And I was <unk> of a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges don't <unk>
As <unk> resident <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited me to speak in sites I never heard of -- and in houses whose existence had ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the morning and into the comfort of life in a suburb -- <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of every one and this <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I said to my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she got on the boat.
He had never been an option.
<unk> told me, "and not being what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the sidelined and the <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking, to talk about it.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of the possible.
And even though I finished my own, I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> career.
There was to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown, a newly coming back in the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that is being grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was an energy there, an <unk> optimism mix of humility and courage.
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a small group of people for the who the motto can't <unk> was a challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was making a giant soup of soup that everybody <unk>
They are going to go down to good at night.
Most of our ideas were <unk> but some brilliant ones, and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and adventure <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up.
On 17 became <unk> by a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of your husband, he caused a <unk> to <unk> and brought the cause itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't do it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room in Sydney when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw him stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell the stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night, a monk came up and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
He asked the <unk> "Why is his hand <unk> and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"Don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Given who we were and how our life built us together, we can now see that the men that would have come to our lives that would have been <unk>
<unk> would have <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I ask myself about the boat.
Who could look like that for right?
But I fear the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a <unk> <unk> in every single <unk> the constant rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them safe, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> today, in the fourth or fifth line.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of the old Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when we Indians wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
In that time when I <unk> the great prince warrior Indian warrior and he had <unk> he took a bow and a <unk> on the floor, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we had was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that got me very excited.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was given to this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic, not to kill her.
As a child my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of life in 50 years was to my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
And I had the sense that the mobile phone -- the luxury watches and the cameras keep it <unk>
We <unk> our inspiration.
And so I was <unk> I threw myself up to this technological world to see how we use it to create magic, instead of killing her.
I took books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
<unk> the text with the image, animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But why do we do that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on top light."
And this --  says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In many times it gets a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live with GPS -- that is led to me.
My inner girl is excited with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic magic -- to those ideas that are <unk> of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned to me exciting.
So over here, we have to shift the iPad to unlock fireflies.
And they actually light your way into what the subtraction of the book.
Another idea that fascinated me of a little girl was that a whole galaxy was in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world gets into a <unk> that I would move into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all of the fantasy books there have always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect of me is to create Indian and contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts at <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
That's why we're bringing them back into a child history.
In a story that deals with today as the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not to come into the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure in which you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had lots of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason children don't do it.
So to recover this ritual ritual that we have to go out and in one chapter, and then you put a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
This is how a digital collection of photos is created on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Inside the connection between magic, Earth and technology is many possibilities.
In the next book we have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and actually augmented reality, you see a bunch of cartoons that appear on the inner plants of the house.
On a moment the screen is filled with leaves leaves here.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We go to a world in which the forces of nature are linked to technology and magic and technology is coming to each other.
It takes the power of the sun.
We're getting closer to our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, happy and child love we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a head of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she lifted me a little cup of coffee or you and I asked patients, family and <unk> What do you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what everybody, or perhaps not all, but most of the projects of <unk> projects, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi <unk> It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> on it on and out.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yeah, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to 95 percent.
But it is so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem is about weight, not at the same time when I need care of <unk> or any urgency of that style but see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect myself to my <unk> Wi-Fi and before I get to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also that patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people in their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week to be available from the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are going to go back from their homes, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position -- they go back to recover control and become captains of their own <unk> but we can also help care of health care because of the challenges that we face, as the shot of the costs of attention to the demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did would like to share it with you with a video.
We all have checks on <unk>
Maybe we even have them on our phones.
We know exactly where ATM ATM are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find strands of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get <unk> saves lives right now.
So what we did was we made <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, they sometimes open up at <unk> and others are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> they already submitted in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality, to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use your cell phone for Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we would like to look at the global level.
We're <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that we will help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on holiday and somebody <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
They could be service services or <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which shows is still in their place.
Please go back into this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take your cameras.
My interest in photography woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
And I mixed with my earlier passion to draw it, but it was a little bit different because using the camera the process was on planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk> <unk>
For me photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
<unk> as this is a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And in spite of it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful images at the same time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way like photography.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capture an idea that with taking a moment.
But what's the trick that makes them look like?
It's the details or the <unk>
Would I feel the light?
What creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic it's realistic but what we think is a realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here are three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if they exist.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's turn to the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different <unk>
And the things that make a picture look like realistic and I think they're those in which they don't even understand the things that are around us in our everyday lives.
But when we combine pictures it's very important to me, because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I'd like to say there are three simple rules that are going to continue to get realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the photos combined you have the same kind of light.
And these two images do these <unk> they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is made impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with perfect ideas.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the lower part is <unk>
But this image is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
In the personal I think it's easier to create a place that comes up because you don't need to put in danger of ideas that have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I was several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores of a different location.
The <unk> part was just captured in a stone <unk>
And yes, I even did the house on the top of the island to make it more <unk>
So to get a realistic outcome I think we need to planning.
You always start with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here each piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and even a realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide of technology, really boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody who took a portfolio of mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general aspect of it.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of mandatory microprocessors versus the power of the local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, like many other we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude, on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about <unk> <unk> it's something new.
This is something weird is happening.
And so I'm just going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why are we going to <unk> technological curves on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them on a regular line where, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I want to give you the diagram would look something ridiculous.
That would be something like that.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you look for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transportation of transportation is as fast as the <unk> technology, we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development, that every few years orders of magnitude.
The question I want to pose is -- looking at these <unk> curves -- we see that they can't forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
So let's put one of two things.
Or it will become a typical curve -- I know like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we now would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we are in a transition from what used to be the world, a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, is, what is that new form of the world?
How new state is <unk>
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember that the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
You can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today does not make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, what that transition would be that you get.
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long-term things.
The time scale that I would like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So you go back about two and two billion years when the Earth was a big sterile rock with a lot of chemicals coming around them.
If we look at the way those chemicals are <unk> we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is that, at that time, there was a little bit of oil <unk> with all sorts of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate out of the outside of the outside and the droplets grew up grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most pressing cell forms -- those <unk> of oil.
But those <unk> were not alive -- in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you <unk> it would be a <unk> distribution of the chemicals that we make.
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow <unk> being better at the time to incorporate chemical chemicals and grow more chemicals and get more <unk>
Mostly, they lived longer, were more <unk>
It was a way of life, and a very simple chemistry, but things become interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution <unk> a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that the writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two and two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed by exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
So here I have 100 <unk> of white powder that try to hide the safety of the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and took it 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every single person in the world and is here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus and would have taken it over the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy about another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things get very different, and that was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information to form in cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, evolved the resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way of avoiding penicillin and the <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that you would get into communities that were in a way, and set up a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all of the individuals of that community become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities were approached so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the entire community of the community together in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life led to another billion years.
And in that stage, we have communities <unk> communities from many different types of different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart of the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so forth.
So these communities evolved and produced levels more interesting than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened inside these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And building very special structures that were not made more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those microbial cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of trying to understand and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary <unk>
Because at that moment as <unk> machine was confined to the duration of an organism, and not to the period of evolutionary time.
So a organism could, for example, learn how to not eat certain fruits because I knew bad and got sick last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that before they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned over hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the communication trick.
So, for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a <unk> idea.
So I'm sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we take a very complicated thing we turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as a matter of mind, we've started to do <unk>
We now move through periods of similar periods to the <unk> organisms, our <unk> methods and processing of information.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> computer <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build on that information.
And that brings us into something much bigger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I would tell you about took one billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, it took a few hundred million years.
And all fours and so on, took less than a million years.
And all about that, like electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that <unk> its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we looked at in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I do a living.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to make it in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> designers, we thought about a level of abstraction, put it into the machine and machine that does that does something that did before it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is the evolution itself.
We put in the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences.
You could run these sequences at random, at random, to run all those programs, and take those who are more than we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to tidying up numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them made it.
But one, luckily, was able to put two numbers into the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that did the <unk>
They were going to get those and <unk> the rest.
And now we were going to get the best out of them to make the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs that <unk> children, who are <unk> <unk> and that the children will fill the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of software programs that had a little more success that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please leave the <unk>
Let's go back again.
We have a few mutations <unk>
And it tries to try and try and do it again and get another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that sequence is absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
These are dark programs, strangers.
But they do the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety of that you get the goal because they come from a bloodline in hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on doing this.
I once went on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to provide a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
And so we started to depend on computers to do different design processes for different design.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
But we don't understand all the choices that there are.
It goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
So they were <unk>
The thing is getting faster and so much faster and so on.
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we are at an analog time to the analog organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent the time enough for letting me give me part of my false <unk>
Before I deal with my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the course of the <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because it's going to go out <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm focusing on one of them and I hope that many of you have heard of.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talk about 300, a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game field without being <unk> and anybody who tried to throw it on the first base is not to reach time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
<unk> <unk>
You know how they call a 300 <unk> <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk> <unk>
By the way, that is somebody from 10 <unk> it hit four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player at the Women's League player in running more 400 strokes on a regular season.
Now I want this to my world of medicine where I feel much more <unk> or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are <unk> to a surgeon who has also a record record in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that you live in a place away and a wanted to be dear has two clogged arteries -- and your family doctor is coming to a cardiologist whose record record is 200 <unk>
But know what?
She's getting better.
And your hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But let them ask them.
What do you think should be the average of hits from a heart surgeon, or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk>
<unk> very good.
And the truth of the matter is that nobody in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, from a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them into the world, and I would include the mandate of being perfect.
I would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the take-home message when I was in medical school.
I was a graduate student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said Brian Goldman <unk>
Just like which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nursing residence at the General of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of <unk> <unk> the origin and the <unk> <unk> <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and not usual.
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis about how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if you were to take it, everything, then I would know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto, when brought to the emergency room in the emergency room where I worked in.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I was working to be applied to a cardiologist I was going to come to that patient.
And it tells the chief of their residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which gave me an heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of <unk> the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, these are blood <unk> and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I was <unk>
I gave aspirin and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave him a little bit of water pills so that it could be liquid <unk>
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the head chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, I would have been able to bring the information out of it.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a <unk> resident to <unk>
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
And when he sent her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner voice that was like, <unk> -- it's not a good idea. I don't know.
In fact, I was so unsure that I asked the nurse who was taking care of the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, <unk> <unk> I think I will be right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he wrote the <unk> and the ambulance along with the ambulance men brought her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I went to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. At that time I did something that I don't do normally, I don't do something that I don't do normally,
I went through the emergency service of the road to home.
And there another nurse, not that I was taking care of Mrs. <unk> before, but another one told me three words, those three words that most emergency doctors <unk>
Other specialists who are scared also, but there is a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
"He remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
He asked the other other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same <unk>
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
In an hour of having come to his house, after I gave her high school, she suffered a collapse and her family called the <unk> the ambulance was brought to the emergency room with a <unk> drop of <unk> which means a severe <unk>
I just breathed and it was blue.
And the emergency staff will <unk> all of its resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care, and I expected against all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days of the next few days it was clear that you never will.
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family got gathered together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And in ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of the people who die.
That was my first experience.
And the weeks before, I was passionate about that and I experienced for the first time, shame that exists in our medical culture and I felt alone, <unk> without feeling that healthy embarrassment because you can't relate to your colleagues.
You make peace and never more makes that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
Shame is <unk> that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad at it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And I felt that.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I was going to get the things and made sure I didn't give me.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did I send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
Little to the feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in one day, he was opened up the sky, and finally the sun came out, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if we were going to get the efforts to be perfect to do not make any more mistakes, I would let those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it went back again.
Two years later, I was an <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in its throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into her throat, I was a bit <unk>
He sent him off and he sent him to his house.
But while he ran to the door he kept pointing his throat.
Two days later, when I came to make my <unk> <unk> my head asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he gave the three words: Do you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in <unk>
He went back and he had no <unk> <unk>
He had a deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google -- it's an infection, it's an infection, but from the upper airline -- and it can cause the close of those tracks.
He, luckily, <unk>
It was <unk> antibiotics for its <unk> and he recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back and went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and again.
Twice in the same turn of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially to work in a hospital, because we were going to be 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
And I had an X-ray X-ray but it turned out, a colleague who was looking at the patient -- some sensitivity in the lower quadrant, and I called a surgeon.
The other patient was having a lot of diarrhea.
He ordered her liquid to <unk> and I asked my colleague who was <unk>
And I reviewed it and at some sensitivity in the lower quadrant, called the surgeon <unk>
Both of them were operated and recovered well.
But every single case I was <unk> I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been over the last five years.
<unk> <unk> and without support.
And here's the problem: if I can't get me and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I could go back to a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party, of course, talking about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my pediatric hospital, the wrong leg, believe he would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of the mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> who make mistakes and the ones who are not.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, as antibodies they start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you take a drug from medicine to people who make mistakes, we'll get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism, I have done a personal study of bad medical care and medical errors to learn how we could from the first paper that I wrote for the "Star <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> white, white, art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where the mistakes happen every day, where one of every 10 drugs that one in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where infections, infections are increasingly more and more <unk> <unk>
In this country, 24 Canadian Canadian were dying by medical <unk>
The U.S. Institute set up 100,000.
In both cases, it's <unk> <unk> because we are not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there's things.
A self-organizing system, where the knowledge is divided every two or three years, and we don't get to us.
sleep deprivation.
and we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with an pain in my chest, and it comes to <unk> eyes and <unk> and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars -- not <unk> their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals to be wrong, well, you won't get anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their more <unk>
In my <unk> white, white, art -- it's already a custom to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone towards them.
And his students were <unk> <unk> down the head and <unk> and they started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human, human tastes human tastes -- they accept it and it's not proud of their mistakes, but he tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
It takes their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with intention to <unk> but a loving way, and support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes of time in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, we <unk> mistakes.
And I feel a lot of it, but I have an effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
Recently, I did a survey to more than 2,000 people and the average number of election that says an average American is about 70 to a day.
Not a lot, in a research followed during a week to a group of companies.
And the researchers recorded the different tasks that are driven by these executives and the time that we used to make decisions about those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> jobs per week.
Naturally, every job was a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of his time.
Now think about your elections.
Do you know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do you figure out the way that we run those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> to choose to <unk> <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
In other ways, when you do a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this <unk> supermarket <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruit and vegetables and about 25 of these <unk> water -- and this was when we had the <unk> water.
I loved going to that store, but I thought, why never I do nothing?
This is the <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk>
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked her, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses with tourists that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had different kinds of different classes.
They put a place for <unk> right at the entrance to the store.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 flavors -- and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop and test the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a <unk> that when only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk> <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
From the time you stopped when there were just <unk> only three percent came to buy <unk>
And when there was six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably have <unk> <unk> less is good for preserving the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the matter of choices is affecting us in good decisions.
We decided to do not decide, even when this was not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings issue.
I'm going to tell you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the decisions about a million Americans, from about one million Americans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funding funds available in savings plans for retirement, <unk> program <unk> people to save the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 options.
We found that the greater the number of funding funds was actually less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was from 70 percent or more, not as high as they want.
And in the plans that there are about 60 to the participation rate -- the rate of participation.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more choices, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So for the people who decided to participate, the older it was the number of choice, more people will be used to avoid the actions or hedge funds.
As soon as there were more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts for market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we have to try to optimize the financial well-being of financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
It is more likely to make the decision, that the <unk> even when it goes against their self-interest.
They're more likely to take the worst decisions in finance, health care.
They are more likely to pick things out less <unk> even though they ever get better.
The main reason is that we were looking at this giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for analyzing and choose from that amazing <unk>
I want to do today -- four simple techniques that we have in one way or another, in different research, so that you can test them in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always bothered when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut, get rid of <unk> options -- there will be a rise in sales -- <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in the choice.
When I <unk> & <unk> country from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> 10 to 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the <unk> corporation just eliminated the products of cats -- that less <unk> got increased <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and lower costs.
You know that the supermarket today, on average they offer 45,000 products.
In a sporting store there is about 100,000 products.
But the biggest store in the current world in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a guy from tomato <unk>
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that has emerged on how to handle the best options is David <unk> the <unk> program.
All Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a insurance fund.
The people who really want to choose, they give them 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know that often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all options that are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask <unk> <unk> the differences there are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience a vacation with everything paid the world's most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave for a few seconds to get it, and then I want you to take a round of applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> Good. Good. Anybody who is ready to embrace the deal.
Are you not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew that there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I would actually hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first trial, which in the second one, but I can tell you that they thought that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of <unk> <unk> which is <unk>
So that people understand the difference between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each other, and that the consequences should be very <unk> very specific to very <unk>
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average, when they use debit cards or credit cards that when they use effective <unk>
Because it doesn't look real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more to it.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> staff who were working on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And in that meeting, it was exactly like <unk> did a little <unk>
And what we added was that we asked the staff that would think of the positive things that they were going to focus on their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to place on their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine aisle for example.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> throughout the corridor of <unk> the exhibit of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the right on the right is <unk> <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the right on the right is <unk> <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and on the right is <unk> but you know what?
This <unk> is totally useless.
The categories need to indicate something that <unk> not as <unk>
You often see this problem with those enormous lists of funding.
Who who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than we think, if only a little bit.
We have to increase the gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision about the purchase of a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allows us to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, so you have to build your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offer each one.
<unk> color in the car. I'm <unk>
<unk> box, four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, a couple of four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few choices, four to 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you were <unk> the default button in each decision, this indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many options to once -- <unk> the <unk> button over and over again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing that I did was disrupt the order where the information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the box of changes don't say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more engaged in the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can make <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented them was designed to help handle the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who will work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful by <unk>
And the more careful careful we can do the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in East Germany -- if you had a typewriter that I had to write to the government.
You had to record a blade of text from written with the machine.
And this so that the government could trace the origin of the <unk>
If they found a writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much that makes it for the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a few yellow printed print on each page that follow a pattern that makes you one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us citizens.
And it's one of the three major causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can set up the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
There are the <unk>
like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot money, huge amounts of it.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> you would raise money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthieu Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their fortunes in line, but they do it by illegal media using rudimentary media to steal money from our accounts when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought on a <unk> computer.
The secret service service was two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this has <unk> millions of dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely that any of us is a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to get worse in worse.
In the future, most of the crimes will happen online.
The second group of metaphor that we observe today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, and they motivate them, the protests, they motivate you, kindness, makes you.
And of the groups like Anonymous has <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a prominent role in the online attacks.
And those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who make it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous that they do to protest and the last group is the U.S. governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority to prevent the Netherlands, or, actually, it was.
It took the break last fall because of a <unk>
It was the security of the site and <unk> a <unk>
Last week I asked him in a meeting with representative government, I asked one of the leaders of Dutch government, asked one of the leaders of people because of the attack on <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die because of a heart attack.
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we would have a foreign authority authority.
And they were going to be <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the protesters protesters <unk> the U.S. <unk> headquarters in April, 2011, and during <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder was notes of a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept a large scale the communications of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
But the Western governments provide the tools for the governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, only a couple of weeks ago I found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If one is suspicious of a criminal case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It <unk> the Internet connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to do all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think close to things like the obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in the privacy game.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
So if we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we have today to be forever.
Be blind in any future government, in a management that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to be worried about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, in the background, and behind the cows, the National Park.
The National Park, National Park doesn't have fences in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, and predators, and these are what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of those who killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and why we value it.
So I grew up <unk> a lot to the lions.
The people were dying are warriors who protect our community, and the cattle, and they also agree with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the Yellowstone National Park.
A child in my community, from six to nine years is responsible for livestock to the livestock and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions gave them fear.
But I realized that this was actually not <unk> because he even helped the lions to see the pen from far.
I don't know about <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick the lions so they believed that I was close to <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  they came the first day and saw the <unk> and they went out, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So <unk> and killed and killed.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come from.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch switch with the light that lights and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp from a <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load battery and battery <unk> electricity to the small box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the box <unk> makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> give up the outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how they see the lions when they come at night.
<unk> lights and <unk> lions so that I am walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses have heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot of it.
And my idea also is used by all Kenya, to freak out other predators as <unk> <unk> and also it's being used to <unk> elephants from the farms.
Thanks to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a scholarship to one of the best schools of Kenya, <unk> School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raise funding and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and we set up lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the meadows of the <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see airplanes would fly, and I was saying it would someday be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come to TED for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer and the pilot and grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a fence -- CA: A close to <unk>
<unk> I know you have electric <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: So you would do it once once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried that, but I got a little bit before, because I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot of the cannon. Richard <unk> you're something big.
We are going to take it in every step that I had my friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned much from the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, are the enemies.
Although I asked myself to ask about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until it all changed <unk>
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I'd never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When I think about this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, that we're ready to die."
I was so <unk>
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child in his arms looking at her face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine, is going to bring North Korea in the middle of the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more frequent <unk> and so much around me was completely in dark at night except by the lights of the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is the boundary between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans, to go through <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river, sometimes.
I can't reveal the details of how we go out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life as refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the refugee refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
And so I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested for the Chinese police and I fell into the police station.
Somebody had accused me to be <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the case, an officer told another, "This was a false report she's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum endangered.
But many can be arrested for Chinese and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although they had <unk> they were eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky in escape many other North Koreans haven't been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans, have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all the world can be done in a second.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided I will be able to go to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a very challenging challenge than I was hoping for.
English was very important in South Korea, and I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a huge gap between North and South.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call my pride with me.
Even though I went to the life in South Korea it wasn't easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming rate.
The North Korean authorities would have some money that sent my family, and as punishment was, my family was going to be displaced to a location in the <unk>
They had to run away.
And so I started planning on how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the road to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border of North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and <unk> to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to make it somehow, for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost trapped various times.
Once, our bus was arrested and tackled by an Chinese police officer.
He asked the identification of everybody, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer approached my family, <unk> I stood up, and I told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the border border <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released by a month,
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was <unk> in prison at short of the South Korea.
I was going and he went between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man said, "What's the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the ATM and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two North Koreans, and to take them out of prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the people <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
And the kind unknown unknown to me is a new hope for me and for the village to come up with the most.
And I showed that the kindness of the strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieve its freedom is just half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with some money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education practices in the English language of jobs and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue to contact with family contact, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to flourish with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Korea.
This is <unk> <unk> stores rapid food, fast, <unk>
So the city planners came together and thought, we're going to change the name of South armed so that it represents something else, so they changed that they changed to the South L.A. as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles --  <unk> <unk> fast food, fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food <unk> Los Angeles Center at home from food places to take and eat in the car.
And the curious thing is that the places of food to get killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of diseases <unk> in Los Angeles City.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times older than say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I emphasize that happen.
And I wondered, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of home you see the effects of today's food system has in their <unk>
I see chairs in <unk> and sold like <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
<unk> is the problem and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of running 45 minutes back to go back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was plant a food forest in front of my house.
On a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters x feet.
The point is, that belongs to the city.
But you have to keep maintaining it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to keep it going.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put together and we started to plant our food, trees -- you know, nine vegetables are <unk>
What we do, we are sort of a <unk> paid kind of <unk> for gardeners of the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city got me on top of it, and <unk> gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made a criminal <unk>
And I said, "Come on on it?
A court command by plant food on a piece of land that nobody else was <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's go back.
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and he talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> members who put a request in <unk> with 900 <unk> were a success.
We had victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called it to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk> terrain.
It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space for plant <unk> million plants.
Why on Earth does not look like this?
It takes a thousand, 10,000 seeds. 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars.
It's my <unk> when I say to people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South ft.
I grew up there. I got my kids there.
I was going to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to <unk> my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Like a <unk> artist that <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a bit of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
It was fun to see what the land can do, if you let their canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness to how my garden became an education tool, a transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We are the land.
It was <unk> to see how the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and provocative act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
And I remember one occasion, who came a mother and her daughter, were like <unk> on the night and were in my garden, and I went out very <unk>
And I felt wrong that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this that way.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hungry, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes people go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "For God no, I am not afraid that you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter to <unk> in downtown Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me to download the truck.
It was great, they taught me his stories about how this had affected me and how they used to plant her mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 garden.
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all of the volunteer plan.
If kids grow up, the kids are going to eat <unk>
If you grow some tomatoes, they eat <unk>  But if none of this are <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and body, they eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which you're stuck. I see some color guys who are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them anywhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids to become aware of their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you have the next George Washington Post.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to carry around and turn them into healthy.
I didn't tell me.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability is you have to <unk>
And what I'm talking about is putting people out of working people, pull the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take your <unk> to take your <unk> right?
That is the weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, they won't be calling me if you want to sit in little chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some traces to talk about doing some crap.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very beautiful road.
It's made out of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water on the asphalt that we make.
And especially if you're going to focus on your bike and these cars go, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can do a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we'd want a <unk>
The solution to that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has pores and water can move through it, so the entire rain water will flow into the sides and you will have a road that it's easy to drive, and no water will ever be.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise disappear, so it's a very silent <unk>
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> See, you see that on this highway <unk> <unk>
First of all, a stone, then more and more and more, and so on, and then -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
Oh. It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can really see how the damage appears in this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt -- as I said, so only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> light, this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they're going to be thrown out of the <unk>
So, if you're driving on the road, you get the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about materials of <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> of the <unk> of that to clean up <unk> and we can cut out the steel wool on little pieces and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of wool on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you can use for a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, it's really good at that.
So what you have to do is they heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones will turn back to the surface.
I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample that I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried lots of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters from the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made a lot of the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine, and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using fibers of steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the road, you can even double the lives of the road, you can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curious about whether this worked.
We still have shown here. It's pretty hot.
In reality, it has to cool first before I can show you how the repair works.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to BBC BBC in his little gray radius.
He had a big smile on his face that was unusual at the time -- because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban was <unk> screamed my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban stood out of Afghanistan and made illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister, that I could no longer be used outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could <unk>
Every day, we made a different path so that nobody could suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide books on market bags, so it looks like we could go shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew we <unk> our <unk> the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every week when the school was a week, because the Taliban <unk>
And we were always wondering what they know of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to go?
We were <unk> but yet the school was where we wanted to be.
I was so lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters are <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. Tell me that his daughter, my mother, my mother, and her father would give him up.
But my mom raised a teacher.
This is her.
He went back two years ago, just to turn our home into school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his entire family to get education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk to not educate their children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember there were times when I was very frustrated by our life and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. Can you help leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to do it.
So, you still want to do it.
I have 22 years old.
I grew up in a country which has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the age, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate myself in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from his home to educate her daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He was not just getting rid of my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I am the first woman who drove him through the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I'm a big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global ambassador, of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of what we <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to take advantage of opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, even though and even in front of an opposition <unk>
As <unk> It's not his true name, and I can't show you their face, but Ahmed it's the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the road for minutes.
When he got home, they are the phone, a voice told him that if he kept her daughter to school, they would go back to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter by his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized in Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who are <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they're often the first compelling <unk> of the <unk> future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like the sake of Afghanistan, we need support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school -- they tell you, remember, it was illegal.
But over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
I'm afraid that these changes are not very much <unk> after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who were going to take care of them -- I see them a future <unk> and change change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> would be <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk> <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the revolution broke out, inspired by the surge of mass <unk> so much from the <unk> revolution.
An forces with many other <unk> citizens inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And the <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and young men -- they were in the middle of the regime, the Fall of the regime, <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You have shown a false courage when you face the brutal <unk>
You have shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the West to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and some losses from about 50,000 dead people, we managed to release our country and <unk> to <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of the society.
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I have loved next to many other women, rebuild civil society -- <unk> a gross transition and fair transition into democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national
There are about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 to <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about developing skills and leadership.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, coordinated orientation <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and by our right to participation <unk> in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was getting more and more <unk> that we would get into the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was practicing and successful.
Women won a <unk> of Congress in the first choices in 52 years.
Yet very recently, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day in violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> old <unk> and <unk>
Another day we had the news of the murder of the American ambassador, and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the killing of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and the <unk> the human rights rights of the prisoners.
Our society, made a <unk> mindset becomes more removed from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here at all about <unk> with our success story of <unk> <unk> and the elections.
Rather, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, chose wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't brought peace and stability and safety to Libya.
The list <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by the selfish policies of domination and <unk> for men as well as women?
Maybe what was missing was not just women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creation of consensus more than the election needed the election, that just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the feminine representation of the female more than I need the representation of <unk> and quantitative <unk>
We need to stop acting as an performance agents and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop an feminine speech, not just <unk> but also put the <unk> instead of <unk> collaboration instead of the competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for the war, it needs desperately to get to peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the <unk> and the <unk> between women's perspectives and the male <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in a existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> feminine and <unk> that embraces all of the humanity of the men and women, that all the tribes and all the towns have been <unk>
And so as the uterus covers completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion to <unk> all of us.
This is what he says, "My <unk> <unk> all the things."
This is what he says, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That all of them are <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a critical question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that everybody is <unk> Why is she left?
Why would anybody stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. He was just at Harvard University.
I had moved me to New York for my first job as a writer and an editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man that I create my alma mater, <unk> to my head with a <unk> loaded with <unk> <unk>
The man who loved one in this world, put a gun in my head, put a gun into my head and get it to <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working on the list of <unk> <unk> <unk> among them Johnson and Johnson Leo <unk> and The Washington Post.
I've been with almost 20 years old with my second husband and we have three kids.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message to you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all the religions, all the religions, all the income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse only happens in <unk> relationships -- <unk> and <unk> or said in other ways, in the families, the last place where we want or we would expect to find <unk> which is why, while domestic abuse, it turns out so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be sitting with a man who sees him, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women in between 16 and 24, they have three times more likely to be likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls in that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim, because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signs or its patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold, rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my feet in New York City and started <unk> me.
He said two things.
The first was that he had just been <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But the thing that struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
He had some big <unk> like apples, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a mate.
He did it especially at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved everything of <unk> that I had gone to Harvard, that I was putting passion in helping teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done before.
And this was why the degree in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was go out of New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> I quit my work and <unk> and I went together.
I had no idea that I was falling in a <unk> <unk> who was coming into a physical trap. financial and financial <unk>
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where I was supposed to have to feel so safe I bought three <unk>
One had the <unk> of the car.
Another one kept her under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived in a kid.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns actually were a message to me, and although I had never lifted me up my hand, my life was already at <unk> every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put the girlfriend of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I felt confident that we were living happy forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a very glamorous sense of the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I never would hurt me.
I spent two times more in our honey.
The first time I was driving to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our Apollo moon was broken by traffic and threw up a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> kept on <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence -- at some point in their life, and the Centers for Control <unk> that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
So back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help <unk> to tackle their demons.
The other question that everybody is doing is: Why don't you simply <unk>
Why didn't I <unk> I could have gone at any time.
So for me this is the saddest and painful question that people, because we have the victims, we know something that normally you have to criticize is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the domestic violence pattern is to kill her.
More than 70 percent of the killing in cases of domestic violence happens after the victim has gone to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent bullying even after the <unk> has gone back to marriage, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to protect the victim and their children, who usually are forced by judges spend time to spend their mother.
And yet we keep asking why it's simply not doing?
I was able to <unk> it because of a final <unk> he beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have shot if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the whole world: <unk> to my neighbors, my friends and family friends and familiar with strangers, and I'm here today because I was here today.
We have the trend for the victims of the victims like headlines -- women -- women <unk> <unk>
The question, "Why is it <unk>
And for some people is a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> were deliberately <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also have learned that learned a lesson that they learned from what happened to them, and they would embrace their lives and lives joyful and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I actually am a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic domestic violence.
I went back to marry a cute man and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to come back to is ever more of a <unk> gun pointing to my head in hands on somebody who says he will.
Right now, the same is thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now that are being <unk> or that they were being <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> might be affecting their daughter, her sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my <unk> particular love of silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Pain is only in silence.
They have the power of domestic violence, simply shedding light on it.
The victims need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of the light talking about it with their kids, their friends, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of the survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a future future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. So I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I am a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that right now, there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dress like this.  luckily, I brought them clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of luck of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to get them right now, but find it out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about as only 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are a lot less <unk> I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to pass this sweater through the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so don't do anything while I cover my mind.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought of myself in six seconds.
And in this picture, I never had a boyfriend, in real life.
He was completely uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that he <unk> the back and <unk> the hair.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I made two days ago for the work, there is very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave -- it means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model because I'm a model, I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it being model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> -- but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty and youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape, and to a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> I've known to take some money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now show <unk> and maybe there's some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> <unk> -- where they're <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- is to say, less than four percent, weren't white <unk>
The next question that people always make me is: Can it be a model when you grow up?"
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know about that.
But then what I really would say to each of these girls is: Why? Can you be anything you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a rat, and <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this spectacular list, still <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> American magazine or <unk> executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that if you want to be a model like saying that you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to prove to you everything that I learned in 10 years as a model -- because, unlike surgical surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've got your studies, your studies, you have a pen and some work on your back, no matter what you're going to do is say, if you want to be a president of the United States, but your warning you want to be weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, you have virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have a <unk>
I know we're getting into a personal terrain, but it was a girl.
And so I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the pictures for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They're <unk> <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and people of <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always doing is -- <unk> things for free?
I have too many heels. I got too many pounds, and I have never use, except the couple before, but the privilege that I get are the ones I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to wear money, and they gave me the free <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a Sorry, a <unk> agent to be able to keep <unk>
I would argue about these privileges in my respect, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price on their mind regardless of who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, the teenagers that were fired and <unk> 86 percent were black and Latino men, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times do I know and <unk>
In researching this talk, I learned that 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure comes up to the 78 percent of the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel so happy and I say.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it was <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also amazing to work with creative and clever and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with a little bit more thin legs and the brightest hair will be happier?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the <unk> legs and the brightest and the more to the fashion -- but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender oppression when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to retain this talk, I hope that everybody gets more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have about success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion ever since I was older enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't know that the <unk>
There were no <unk> <unk> and no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a little bit of care in the lighting.
In fact, most of them took them tourists at random.
My story begins when I was <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this photo holding my daughter in the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and 5.
He happened that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When my third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you back to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we start to ask the tourists that they were going to take us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never denied and, fortunately, never no one has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five-year-old girl could understand it.
These pictures are much more than a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in October week and think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, while we always get the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how it interacts and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we expect with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of the travels we were walking, when suddenly he was stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the shop shop that <unk> from the small visits of the previous visits were <unk>
And I described that there was sense to the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that reminded his heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York City.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is memories of memories.
So, I want to share the idea of actively participate in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many family pictures.
I am always the picture of the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come in the picture, and you don't want to be able to get up to someone and asked, lets us take a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most <unk> birds.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughs, and it also has a stupid silly character.
More recently, if you've been following the press that you get laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that relate to the <unk> Parliament but I don't accept.
I don't accept. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of diseases.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far away from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> are better at least as well.  There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World that are largely found in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> from the World Bank, where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face of extinction.
So why are the <unk> that are important, first of all, provide organic services that provide vital <unk>
They're our <unk>
<unk> the carcasses to the bone.
They help killing all the bacteria to help absorb anthrax than not to be because they would stretch and cause huge losses to livestock and disease in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of diseases.
<unk> also have tremendous important importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the <unk> and the <unk> and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and <unk>
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the Tasmanian goddess of 10 heads <unk>
In <unk> culture is very important <unk> in places like Tibet in places like Tibet -- there's no place to bury the dead dead or wood to find out, so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, where six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> They use this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of endangered risk -- which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, it's <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey from livestock consumption that has been treated with a drug <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Because there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a massive ticking time bomb.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up the top of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They are <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrific trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and to the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine the basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so I'm going to focus on a locally grassroots problem.
We have to work with governments at the regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciate the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we make.
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. They can write a letter to your government and tell you, we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you walk out of this room, I will report on the <unk> but talk to your families, with their kids, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said it changed because he saw them flying without effort without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorer without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East Coast <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a nonprofit NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead, everything we played is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from country to grow food.
So we got with the seeds <unk> south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach local tomatoes and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, the people weren't at all interested in doing that, and so they would love them to come to work, and sometimes they weren't going to be <unk>  We were amazed that the local in that fertile valley, had no agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't go to anything, we just said, "Thank God that we are here."  Let's spend time to save the people of <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was <unk> <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> In Italy, a bird would grow up this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look at how easy the <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red, at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "My God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't we do it? You never get <unk>
I thought only we were Italians <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what Americans were doing what the English was doing and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you know, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk> --  <unk> seeing the waste that we would give to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors -- we've given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage that we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just two things: or the <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
However, two different things.
I try to deal with any of a different culture as if it were my kids, "I want to love it.
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if it were my <unk>
That's why white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap on the face, "The <unk> is <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor, and he said, we can just imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided at 27 years only to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start nothing, you ever motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people, who have the dream to become a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
It will never come into a community with an idea, and it sits with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We came together in a cafe. We met a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not once, at once, I would love them, but not in <unk> meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the <unk> meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never say, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, how opportunity have you <unk>
So, planning has this blind point.
The smartest people of their community, you don't even know it, because they don't have their public meetings.
What do we do is we work one, and we work on face to face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor, the family of the business of the business of the business, which is set up with you at his house, at the table of his kitchen, and that helps him find the resources to transform his passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city from Western Australia
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this <unk> garbage where we come to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 design projects, and the government came to me to ask to say, "How can you do that?
So how do you do that? And I said, "I did something very, very, very difficult.
And so the government says, <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most grandiose business advisers in history, passed them to '96, it was a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of death of the death of the <unk>
So now it <unk> reconstructing <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you.
You have to offer them <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then you have to come into mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 <unk>
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and <unk>
What do you talk to you about this tomorrow?
Ordinary local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution, <unk> fossil revolution, <unk> <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
government?
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a magazine magazine about many, many years.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> came up with this group of people -- and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move the population from New York to <unk> -- six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we built in New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States emerged <unk> companies <unk> <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories -- factories in places that are <unk>
<unk> Michigan.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk to you.
Then you have to offer you an absolute <unk> <unk>
And then I grew up, you will have to tell you to tell you about <unk>
The smallest company, the largest company, it has to be able to do three things: the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell you with a fantastic marketing and you have to tell a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be done, sell and search for money.
It doesn't exist.
This was not yet born.
We have looked and looked at the 100 molecular companies of the dark world, <unk> <unk> all the new companies, <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
I never thought about the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't only when it started.
Nobody starts a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> around bars in <unk> along with their devoted <unk> who will do for you, what somebody did this guy who speaks about this <unk> somebody who asked you, what does it?
What can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do this."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, that's why we don't change a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much do my neighbors come from their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door <unk>
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand better our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for the cows stores so that our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> which gives shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries, and I trust a city.
It is always supporting the music.  There is a show in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest number of U.S. U.S. properties.
I live close to this house and I thought that I could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also changed my life forever.
In 2009 I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And it made me deep gratitude for time and lived in my life.
It gave it clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But let me go through this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to get to catch the day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends I transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and painted on it for <unk> <unk> of dying <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to expect this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and kept on <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before they die I want to be judged by <unk>  Before they die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before I die. I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die. I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die. I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die. I want to spend once else."
Before I die. I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before they die, I want to be totally myself."
This space abandoned is become constructive and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at me <unk> and they gave me comfort in tough times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It tries to understand our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is about giving supporting the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and we change it.
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community community.
And so with my colleagues in the civic center we did a kit and now have been made up in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if they give us an opportunity to express ourselves and share with each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions that's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is brief and fragile.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that we care about more power.
If you think about death -- our life <unk>
Our spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more means to share hope and stories, the people around us, cannot only help us improve places, can help us improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is <unk> it's high and <unk>
It doesn't speak, but transmits joy that some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love.
What's shared. <unk> happen to happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
You don't care about the religious differences and notice this: it's never <unk>
When they sing songs, our childhood, trying to say the words that I can't even know -- I remember one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high. It's very hot.
<unk> the <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but he reminds me of the year where I came out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, he would be dressed in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like <unk>
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although they wouldn't consider them inside of it, that could only mean one thing that was <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social media and sometimes learning the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests it in a different way, from there that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that goes faster in the world, there is no cause any <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new way to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't look very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure on the smallest things, like putting the cars in line around the room, looking at the machine and eating anything that <unk> <unk>
As it was growing more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the Digital hyperactivity had something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature -- a kid who would see the world without <unk> a human being there never had.
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments when I wish that they would be just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change the normal.
<unk> happens to the beauty that give us differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that anybody is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and to you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that you get. It's a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your inner and, frankly, the search for normal, is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change is dies in the time that we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what it must have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State was asked to me, a professor of communications, that gave a class of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> really <unk> from these students with their great minds, their big books and their big <unk> words.
But as those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt like when he fell through the hole in the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
<unk> so I felt when I had these conversations with the students. I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a great deal of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our largest challenges and health care and health care, each other, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that the science is sexy and engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us simply that studying the <unk> but study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing their science, <unk> <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> affordable is not the same as <unk>
Instead, as Einstein said, everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can actually communicate their science without engaging the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies are ways to connect and <unk> with their content.
And when I present their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
You have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do <unk> The bullets are killed and <unk> your presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's supporting too much in the area of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is far more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple word, <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a bit, and then we provide graphs that are going to address our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what they were <unk>
I think these are just some keys that can help the other open and look at the country of the wonders that science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all over the morning in Oxford English is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor <unk> from the 19th century that he defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public charge -- no matter -- and that when he wins, he gets the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means to <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the camera <unk>
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy who was <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
They brought him in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to cope with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of them think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of speech.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all sorts of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen King by a given shot.
And there might be <unk>
Everybody got tired of them, because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
And I read the newspaper from a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want the Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it if he was just giving him or his <unk>
So they wanted to give it the most <unk> more dangerous title that they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
president, didn't invent the title. It was already before, but it just meant <unk> that we had a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> government, but it was really a insignificant.
And that's why the Senate was <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, <unk> We can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign and meet with <unk> <unk>
And who would take a serious title with such <unk> and insignificant title, as President of <unk>
And then finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> by the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep us waiting for the other years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is most important, and with this is the title of President of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads, and the largest economy of the world and a floating vehicle fleet and so on.
The reality and history have measured the title of <unk>
So he won the <unk>
<unk> his title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> -- well, it was a uniqueness over then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear heads and so forth.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and I would like to <unk>
The politicians try to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, actually change the words much more than the words that they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under the land in the illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones with <unk> tools.
Like the other, I carry a firefly cheap light of light -- he holds my head with this <unk> <unk> and I barely can see the branches of the branches that hold the walls of the subway hole that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
He <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met a <unk> that I met the control and dropped <unk> feet in that well.
While I talk to you today, these men are deep in that hole by risking their lives without paying you and often dying.
I walked out of that hole and I went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the <unk> Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there was a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO which is involved in modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not as grade.
When we finished talking to me I felt very sad, I was honestly getting to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me feel like <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So my journey started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
A few even, I considered them my second home.
But this time, it was <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are now over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of African Africans during all of the slave slave
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of <unk> 50,000 people today.
However, today we can enslaving entire families for generations by <unk> <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, the slavery generates profit from more <unk> billion dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false education promises and better work to then find that they're forced to work without pay, under threat to violence and cannot escape.
Today, the slavery today operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who are producing these are disposable people.
<unk> exists in most of the world, and yet it's illegal for all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This is strange and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a <unk> temperature, men, men, women, kids, in fact, families <unk> in a heavy overcoat of <unk> stack in their heads, until 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk>
<unk> by <unk> and tiredness is working in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no pause for eating and eating and <unk> and severe <unk> made to pee out pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera turned too hot to play and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run into the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> which was on my side quickly, and said, "You don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly to show emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I wasn't citizenship in that country.
I could put them in an worse situation than they were already gone.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system for his liberation and he complained that it was <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children <unk> stones for rocks for miles per mile per trucks that were hoping down.
These big <unk> were even more heavy than the kids that the load of them and the children would put them into their heads with <unk> <unk> made from <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something that <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been the whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
When you hear the word <unk> we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness, they warned me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
It took me on the stairs so they were going to give this <unk> basement of faint <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as it's known as the craft, are local to prostitution prostitution too.
They have small rooms -- private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls, and kids, some of that only seven -- are forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided through a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their own customers.
On the <unk> I remember making sense of <unk> <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
He only had a <unk> the stairs where they were going.
There was no <unk>
There were no windows enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, since we played a very difficult subject, it's important to point out that the slavery, even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people in the age of agriculture, in rating in the domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often associate with labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families in the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait of it.
The black hands are from the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is toxic.
My translator told me their stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, power out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 <unk> children in Lake <unk> Lake largest lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went through a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a family of fishermen in a boat, two older brothers, some younger children, make sense of it.
<unk> were all <unk>
Children are separated from their families -- they were missing and forced to work on their boats on the lake, despite not knowing how to swim.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me there was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
The branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, and with fear, they get to the water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it has always been forced to work in the lake.
By fear of his love, it's not going to flee and as long as life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it tries young slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one one.
On the cold night and <unk>
And I can point out that these networks weigh over 400 kilos when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes what is possible.
Who will come to be because someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his motorcycle suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and the window.
It was asked to do it by a dirt road to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we would love to get out of the car, and asked the driver to come out quickly.
And then they pointed to this path immediately and said, "This is the path, this is the path.
As we started to go down, we took the <unk> out of the road, and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> and so I put the pictures of pictures on my head as they were looking at these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up in one of course and we had in front of a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied up with their back, and while they were looking for gold, <unk> in wastewater.
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember he looked at her eyes tired, <unk> because many of them had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> are down to 90 feet and these people carry heavy stone bags that will then be attached to another area where we were putting the stone to be able to extract the gold.
First of all, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer to the margin of the margin we see the other less fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it is very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
When he died his uncle, <unk> I inherit debt of the uncle on the mines.
When I met him, I had worked on 14 years and the spinal cord that you see here is a product of an accident that the doctors said that it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and, however, that is forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet he has to be liberated and educated with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, for a remote possibility to a remote possibility of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give you witness to them and we will do everything possible to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not magazines -- people real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect for their lives.
There's no day to happen I don't think about these so many beautiful people that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images show a force in those who you see in people like you, and I hope that force turns into a fire and that <unk> fire about slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do some peculiar math and there's a particular problem for whom the <unk> are kind of a management unit.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
That's why I want to try to explain to you what I do.
dance is one of the most human activities.
And we would get rid of the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk>  we're going to see more ahead.
But the pursuit of an extraordinary training degree -- a high level of dexterity and probably some <unk> initial <unk> that well can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability to do with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a kind of a ballet ballet <unk>
In the last few years, it's made much progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an weakness <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective measure and an objective measure and <unk>
But it is frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement we have no biological <unk> so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means outside of clinical trials, they're never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test themselves?
It wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do with you as the conventional form of a try, you can see, in some sense, at least we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the ropes.
It shows somebody healthy while it emitted sounds to speak -- we can imagine as dancers of a vocal desire, because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes that needed it.
And as the <unk> requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's take the time for a child to learn to talk.
From the sound, we can trace the position of the vocal chords as it <unk> and as well as Parkinson's affect the limbs also affect the adult organs.
And the bottom plot can you see an example of <unk> <unk> of the vowels.
We see the same <unk>
Be a <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more peaceful and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with clinical clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> Both use existing infrastructure.
Needless to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
They're both <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens to happen.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it comes on a massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce their patients.
You wouldn't need to go to the clinic for <unk> <unk>
With <unk> <unk> we could get objective data.
We could do a <unk> massive cost for clinical trials, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on the overall scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So by going to give the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> Initiative of <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local <unk> affordable lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with <unk> and <unk> can call it low price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> -- taking all these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What about these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the so-called <unk> you have to indicate whether or not the disease, TR: Sure.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> they may not be <unk>
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking for <unk> the government factors looking for the actual markers of the disease.
TR: So you have a <unk> precision at this time?
It's much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job and now it has been shown that it works on the mobile phone network too, which we <unk> the project. Now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> creatures.
We were <unk> in the dark, there are no windows and usually, we avoid sunlight.
We do the little thin role models -- the perfect skin -- even more perfect -- we do the impossible, and we have to focus on the press all the time, but some of us are truly artists with many years of experience and a true taste of the images and the picture.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Soon time later, an organization where it was voluntary -- there was <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishermen of people located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people that were affected by the wave.
<unk> water level went on over 24 feet tall and more than three kilometers away in.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We got rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and we leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of food -- dead fish -- the local factory <unk>
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found photos and <unk> photos and cameras and <unk> cards.
Everybody did the same.
<unk> and push them to different places of villages around <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those photos represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While we were running from the <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean up the bathrooms -- <unk> giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And there they took them and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was going to go beyond my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some of them who had more than a hundred years old were still in the lab about the lab, I couldn't help and think about how to fix that <unk> and I could repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive, I knew we had to try.
So we started to tweak the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to get <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time, they got more lucky, and more photos and they needed more <unk> so I entered Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people of 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we gave <unk> a village to North <unk>
And once a week we use our scanner scanner in the libraries of temporary communities that had <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
And the time you put in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could take an hour. It was a few weeks ago.
It could take a few months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using the areas that color and detail the water had not <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures <unk> in saltwater, covered in bacteria, with algae, and with algae, even with oil, all of it next to the time of time I continue to <unk> by hand that was a major part of the project.
We couldn't tinker with the photo unless it was clean, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a guide with a <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more and even more <unk> pictures.
As he once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was kind of lucky to the photos.
And he had started <unk> her, but he stopped realizing that we were going to get it even further.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their own husband and their own face would not be able to reconstruct the images in a single photo and tinker with the whole picture.
When I picked their pictures shared something from their story with us.
A few colleagues from her husband found the photos on a fire station between the rubble of the department so far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Her young children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in water.
It took a week to find his whole family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave his photos his youngest son was at a 14 years.
In spite of all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past that had not been tagged in the past day -- when everything happened or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up there -- hundreds of them helped us to clean up with more than 135,000 photos -- the great <unk> -- the vast majority of them became hands of their <unk>
Over 500 volunteers from all around the world helped us back to 90 families -- hundreds of totally <unk> photos and <unk>
So during this time, we don't really spend over <unk> 1,000 in teams and materials, most of them on ink for <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
A photo is a memory of somebody or something, one place, a relationship, someone wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would get to us, but the first thing that we would try to look for.
And this was what the project was about to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to somebody their connection to the past.
When a photo comes back to somebody, it's an enormous difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger, I can bring something, using their talent to something that will be not thin models of perfect skin.
I would just like to read this email. He sent him Cindy that day I came back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, and I was amazed because a picture similar to my family grandmother, my mother, I and my daughter, <unk> it <unk> our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs are the themselves, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us wonder and curious with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition from one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion of light moving.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without X-rays, and they defy the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and switch on and put it on a <unk> or a second or a second -- to create a <unk> package.
And that pack of photons, that <unk> travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a regular bullet than a regular bullet than a regular bullet than a regular bullet than a regular bullet than a regular bullet than a regular bullet than a regular bullet than a regular bullet than a regular bullet than a regular bullet than a regular
If we take that bullet and this pack of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do those photons come inside this <unk>
What is the aspect of the light in the <unk>
Now, all of this --   remember, all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes for us to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light moving.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  -- <unk> many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a <unk> pack on <unk> and that inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel around the table and because of the ideas of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and the current and we make it <unk> the same distance and you see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would lead us to look at that movie?
One day? A week?
It would be a very boring film -- a slow bullet in motion.
And how about testing <unk> <unk>
You can see the waves of the table, the tomato tomato and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at this <unk> once this <unk> you'll notice that, as the light falls off, they are still bright.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light is bounces back into its interior and back after several <unk>
In the future, when this <unk> is on your cell phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to touch it.
Why do we create this camera at MIT? India?
As photographers, as photographers, you know, if you take a photo, it goes very little light into it.
But we're going to be a billion times faster than the longest exhibition than the shortest exhibition -- so you just get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that pack of photons, million times, and we recorded it again and again with a very distinctive <unk> we took these data <unk> and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all those data in crude and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can be flying.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow you to see the <unk>
The idea is that we could drop something out of the door. You want to go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our paper in Nature <unk>
And a fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, at slightly slightly different.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good time resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects but we don't know what dot corresponds to how far away.
So projecting a laser can record a photo <unk> that you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we will be able to see the symmetrical object.
Can we look at 3D <unk>
This is our reconstruction of it.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that were vibrating collisions with which is around the <unk>
Or we could look for survivors at dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build <unk> capable of seeing the interior of the body <unk> <unk> and the same thing for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and blood is quite difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists so that they start thinking about <unk> as a new set of visualization to solve the problems of predicting the next generation.
So as a scientist, <unk> himself a scientist, I became the science of art, an art of photography.
I realized that all the data scans that we collected every time are not just scientific visualizations but we can see it.
And creating a new form of computer photography with slow motion and motion code.
And look at those ripples remember, the time between each one of those waves is just about <unk> a second.
But this is also a little bit fun.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> you miss away from us.
<unk> should be moving towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording about the speed of light, we have strange effects, Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which events happen in the world are sometimes being invested in the camera.
They are the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a cell phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone you can record a song, you would go to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> in 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that time, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people <unk> in search of change.
This is the fall of 1989. You can imagine if all these people gathered that we were looking for a change, had a mobile phone in our pocket.
So who of the successes have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Hands up your mobile phones.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everybody has a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my cellphone, and how it changed my life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 percent of information lines.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission in the E.U. presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
So this directive says that every <unk> telephone company, every single Internet provider in all Europe, has to store a wide range of information range from users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the cell phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company, or your <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, and priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who went out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
<unk> was the secret police of Eastern Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all of this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who was the largest phone company in Germany, who will tell me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to <unk> and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you're <unk> my life.
So I decided to get a lawsuit for court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of the end, I agree.
<unk> the demand and they sent me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court Court failed the <unk> for German law enforcement from the E.U.
So I got this ugly about a <unk>
And there was this.
Thirty and five thousand miles -- 30 percent of information.
I first saw them, and I said, well, it's a huge file. Okay.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
Was it a bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and <unk> go back and forward.
You can see every step I want to do.
And you can see how I'm going to go from <unk> to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we're talking about a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call them among them.
And then one calls the other, and the other one, and we end up with this huge communication network.
You can see how your people communicate to each other, what time they call each other, what time you do to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who send an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, you have a mobile phone in my pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I participated in this protest, and if <unk> had known who the leaders, this had never happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, maybe he had never happened.
And as a result, not the fall of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible in and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and want to be <unk> forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go home tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not <unk>
When you go home, tell your representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones that will remind them to remember they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me into the world.
I put my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.

Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not the <unk> because my parents were brothers, while they are.
It only happens by accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I am <unk> I'm not source of inspiration.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you've had to be disabled again.
Come on a walk.
Christmas Christmas is in the shopping center, drive in circles looking for parking lot, and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>

I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same first time.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York to do it.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the unable you can."
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> dance.
If my three sisters older <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters older people were going to the public school, my parents would go back to the school system and get tired of me that I went, and if I didn't look at all the ultimate note all there were all the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk the five years by putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
The other approach I used to be used was hang on a dollar in front of me so that we will.
The <unk> that I carry inside was really strong, and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 now, and they continue to be all of the family --  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as <unk>
The people that I grew up with no problems with my faith.
However, it looked like a lot of a lot that died of hunger during the <unk>
I was telling them that he had enough fat to live three lonely months without eating it, so I <unk> from dawn to sunset it is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I do too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vacation on the East coast, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine all of the <unk> we were interested in <unk>
On summer holiday often my father was about <unk> so I was drinking milk and <unk> and put me warm cups on the back, and I remember in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the short cure was yoga.
I have to say that it's very boring, but before doing yoga was an comedian of <unk> who couldn't stand <unk> <unk>
And now I can tell you in the head.
My parents would take this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the University of the Arizona, University of the state of Arizona, because I walked in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater.
I was all <unk>
I did all the least smart tasks I took out the ultimate note in my lectures, and also their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my <unk> teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow to <unk>
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> when I finally got a <unk>
I have paralysis <unk>
At the end of the course of the end it <unk>
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  You gave him to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running out of the director of the theater, crying as if somebody had killed my cat, ask her, "Why and she told me that because they thought he could do the risk scenes.
And I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the risk stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that was literally born and gave an actor without cerebral <unk>
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> <unk> actors for disabled papers.
By <unk> I went back home, and my first tour <unk> was a little bit extra for a <unk>
My dream came true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> <unk> <unk> not white, <unk>
It's just <unk> to perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made me <unk>
And in my first tour I took it back and famous comics in New York to New Jersey and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he went at the high speed of the New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs all over the United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little uncomfortable that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> Festival of New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and once you remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier than fighting the stigma challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news news program, on the <unk> by Keith <unk>
I walked as if I went to a graduate dance, I joined a study, and they sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, "Excuse me, you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I hold on to the desk desk so I would not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
At the end I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew you wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but he was just a full-time participant and hit my chair.
Something really fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that children are <unk> but they never had a little bit of me and no older than me.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What disease is that?
We really should pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even to add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> you can't make somebody in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
The disability are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
Doctors said that I don't know -- but I'm here in front of you.
Yet we have grown up with media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create the most positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there was more positive images, it would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all the society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> the red carpet by the <unk> <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the <unk> world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give kids Palestinians to be a tiny bit of what my parents would give me.
It was the only time my father saw me live alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
My name is <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know their story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This people are close to <unk>
<unk> drives the small people to poverty and on the brink of <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, no job, no perspectives in future.
He was just living in a tent in the city outside <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
And one day she offers him to take him back to dinner, and after dinner, and <unk>
He knows a dynamic of people who give him a break.
It gets a little bit of money to get her clothes, money to send home your family.
They show a young guy.
He finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a bomb.
That little boy in that small village with the dreams of the great city was the terrorist bomber and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a terrorist organization connected to the Qaeda.
So how did the story of a small town of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends up with him.
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start its future, waiting for a perspective of future, and this was the first thing that got stuck.
This was the first thing that we call "the <unk> <unk>
And his story is repeating in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young unemployed urban <unk> riots in <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of the opportunity, in well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunity, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> to be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, 70 percent of young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital <unk> the hospital where I was born.
I remember going to be in front of that hospital I was talking about thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor some young leaders at a business peak.
And we went to about 90 young leaders who were <unk>
And we sat there and we had a rainfall of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, that because I was a graduate university <unk> frustrated, was the perfect white <unk> for Al <unk> and other organizations that are <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle to get from point to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some time expanding hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this happen?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the entrepreneurial spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so long enough.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if he wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from the abroad.
If you give somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those of us who grew up during civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> that he said, could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for business, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now are working on the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, its innovation, it really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they might be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a big step, but young people need the capital to do their reality.
They need expertise and orientation to <unk> in the development and set out of their businesses.
And we would bring the young people with the resources that they need, they need the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and to create real <unk> for urban growth.
For me, community spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Peace Park. This is how it called, when it is created, transforming the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the motorcycles for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, is to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation and have more stories about flowers and <unk> of the Peace <unk> that <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> mountains in the mountains of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was making the sheets of <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the path that we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that ground.
We went to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> <unk> to a beautiful lake -- when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four square feet with an apple hearts and <unk> balls of aluminum <unk> and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they had to do, who they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter like <unk> or where you get to <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in Paris or <unk>
So here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, for 11 thousand tons of waste and 2,000 thousand tons of waste products every day.
I wanted to know that as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities throughout the city, and I learned a lot, but I was still a <unk>
I needed to go into more.
So I began to work as a trash trash.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And I <unk> the mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody asked about the smell.
It is there, but it's not as widespread as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong you can get away quickly.
It costs a lot to use weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the world's largest <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're going to go out and go into traffic all day and go through all around you.
They just want to <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the worker.
And the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the crap is as an force of nature itself.
You never stop coming.
It's also like a kind of breathing or circulation.
It always must be moving.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think that the <unk> of waste is the most important work on the city streets for three reasons.
They are the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of waste efficient and effective each day, this starts to <unk> from its <unk> and its dangers inherent will threaten us in very real ways.
And so we had controlled for decades and centuries and <unk> and start to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing we don't have space for the new way that the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's endangered behavior.
I'm not advocating that capitalism, just by the relationship.
And then there's what I call our average speed we need.
And I mean by that simply at the speed that used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't get rid of us, and we were usually <unk> and we had our coffee cup -- our bag of coffee, our water bottle.
We use them -- we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that will be taken from it.
So I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the waste of waste that maybe help reduce stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Their work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when you go to it?
And their work allows us to do our own own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us apart from ourselves, from our own <unk> our own <unk> and that flow always has to stay in one form or another.
On one day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection truck on the street, grabbed my little kid down and went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey from paper paper like I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that day in particular, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I started looking at waste waste, and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> and we worked together many times and made us good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we should have to include and have in account all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor labor.
The city waste is what we think when we talk about it is three percent of the number of the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one to see someone whose job is to clean the crap from you, take a moment to get it to you.
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work is focused on the connection to thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I brought together two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And they share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of various stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> generates heat in the interior, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's about a temperate weather, that's about 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And third, he looks like it has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> for a place that is so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted by the ancient market that is this structure in the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought, that that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a modern building, from various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the <unk> the site, which is located in a much of a lot of growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not there.
And it's also between two streets parallel that they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries in the building.
And this is spreading with an <unk> <unk> which creates an outdoor space in the building that was taken into its own shape and rain.
And around this space we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the space.
I also thought, how can we close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that <unk> the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a fabric similar to a concrete piece of concrete with <unk> to allow the air input and also the light, but in a <unk> fashion.
And then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me do the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of pieces, which are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center. It was not what you get.
But in fact, we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the commercial center of the mall because in the end of the world there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was far more economic -- not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it doesn't need to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where the electricity is almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting yourself on the roof.
And then under those panels and we think of the roof as a new public space of meeting and bars that would create this <unk> <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collected water for the <unk>
It's expected to be the principles of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master master plan and services in Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the biggest thing I have designed for, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve gates of access to almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation we did was extend the streets, creating 12 early blocks similar to size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some <unk> points in relation to the idea of the interconnected doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best guidance for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So we would give a scheme to make sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections for the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that make greater density at the higher levels and lower density in the plant line.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as to give the community space filled with construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and go and go and make such activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same rate that the buildings grow up.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and that they have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had large amounts of hair and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> It was super strong for state capitals very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I had my precious plan.
And one day I stayed after the back of school, I was a little afternoon and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
And when the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took out of the table from my Sunday school book.
And then I did.
<unk> ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just some like this.
All like this.  And I set up my book to <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had really good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all rows of <unk> and I was just a row in front of it, just by being there, since I was there.
I'm still surprised by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never met.
It's that everything was <unk>
I never got <unk>
But most of all, I was struck by the reason why I would be bothered by this <unk> so small, it was so good for <unk>
And I washed the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies have jealousy.
Also, the <unk> <unk> are very <unk>
We know that the <unk> are the number one cause of children?
And yet I've never seen a study that will observe loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
And so you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab in which you study the <unk> in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> it would have been literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
He wouldn't have Shakespeare.
<unk> the high school lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> almost to the <unk>
This year, 100 years of his masterpiece, "In <unk> time <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> my God, all we could have.
We think in a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk>
We forgot about how hard that image.
We forgot about how <unk> it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said were as tough as <unk>
I don't know how the cat, the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the novel and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the <unk> that you get to the person, to their wish, their <unk> are a good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about life of other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Now, to be a <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details would happen to <unk> the knife, right?
<unk> do all of us, <unk> <unk> and that's something that I had understood it.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me to another, maybe right now.
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every crazy charm that <unk> detects in his lover -- adds it to his collection of <unk> instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> was notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break out with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> you have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> you like the large amounts of hair and the nice little quantities of hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> got rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful   <unk> links the <unk> <unk> in the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of soon listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his <unk> then defending those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search of knowledge, search of the truth, a painful truth, in fact, to what we <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, of the best.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who makes us suffer, that it makes us suffer, it causes us a much deeper range of feelings and vital that a wise man can tell us <unk>
It's telling us we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other emotion that we were <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at with intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud went to visit by a young man who was being consumed with the idea that his woman was <unk>
And Freud said that there was something strange about that man who was not <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or Weren't you <unk> with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
The novels really describe very well how the <unk> make us look at intensity but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, we more we become residents of fantasy.
And because of this reason, I believe, <unk> lead us to make violent acts or illegal acts.
<unk> drive us into behave in a whole range of ways.
Now I'm thinking about the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michigan in 52 years old was captured by having created a false account on Facebook since he was sent to <unk> <unk> for a year.
For one year.
She was trying to hide the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted to awe.
Let's be realistic.
So what a huge thing, even though we go, creativity. Right?
It's like novel.
Like a Patricia of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> -- Mr. <unk> books that try to do the <unk> <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in an instant.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to <unk> your self and <unk> from whatever you ever saw, and it's under the floor.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route from Tom <unk>
I can't give you all around the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not safe, when they're at a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> Street Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think of the curse of Professor <unk> that criminal genius,
But I've always had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs to <unk> <unk> and he needs the genius of <unk> but he bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but it takes it out, and it would be <unk> in each of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you walk in, you go down to all of your solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who doesn't want to hold your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see to <unk> transferred in history, I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat them as a problem of geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a <unk> minute there is the opposite side.
The next one is the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to make it from the greatness of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have the fiction <unk>
It's only fiction that jealousy. jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> invited to the table.
And look at what the sweet sweet man, the scary Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, she Buzz Aldrin jumped outside the Apollo <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Aral Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence in the gray surface -- was the culmination of a collective process of <unk>
The Apollo program was the largest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked the 20,000 businesses, universities and government agencies in government.
People died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on top of its surface, of which <unk> after Armstrong died, last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do I <unk>
They didn't brought a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynics answer is that they were because the Kennedy Kennedy I wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice <unk> gives us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some ask, why do you <unk>
Why do it turn it into our <unk>
And you could also ask, why would you climb the most <unk> mountain going.
35 years ago, why will fly on the <unk>
Why does Rice play <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
In the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of the technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technology's thinking.
The first half of the 20th century produced the line of assembly and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> <unk> and was removed from smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew at 40,000 miles /
From 1970, no human being turned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism about the power of technology has evaporated into the power of technology has evaporated down to see that the problems we imagined that the technology was going to solve as a clean energy, create a clean energy, to cure the cancer, or to feed the world to the world of global population seem to have a
I remember the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the escape tube <unk> by the rocket. Saturn <unk>
Now, I knew this one that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was completely sure that I would be able to see the colonies on Mars.
So that belongs to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We heard it over the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists had found us and they were enriched with trivial, trivial, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which is <unk> that you've created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years where they were <unk> <unk> Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically, incentives that risk capitalists offer entrepreneurs at risk.
Silicon Valley says that the risks at risk caused by creating ideas by creating ideas by funding problems, or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their peak that were not worrying about the risk, they preferred a small investment investment that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had a problem to invest in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and which development is in the long term, they have never invested in developing technologies that are intended to solve big problems, because they don't have a commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we will not solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if you were <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would take a political decision that was popular, and that's never going to happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar -- wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want some sources of alternative energy to compete at the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policy and treaties on international deals with the development of <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of price control of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see an energy policy from the U.S. or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, It turns out not to be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of failure.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for the storage and process of food, but there will be famines as there was bad governments.
Finally, big problems are sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president was leading to the cancer war in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, seem to have found effective health treatments, and viable.
The tough problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and <unk> but these four elements have to be <unk> political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must be supporting <unk> must be really about a <unk> problem, and we have to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like this as a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it serves with those bill.
But it's a role model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how hard and the dangerous, there is no science science mythology like about exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by <unk> the ideas that have about confidence.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a big decrease of trust, it's a very widespread outrage.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover confidence.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task have been wrong.
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task that I think gives you a clearest idea about it.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It reminds me to think that it may have gone down in some sort of or institutions and that might have gone up in others.
I don't know.
But I can turn to behavioral surveys and opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that the trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same distrust.
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, and they are still pretty much <unk> to make nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But is this evidence enough?
So what you record is that you record are of course views.
What else can you get?
What you see is the generic attitudes that people manifests when you do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody would tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
You probably ask for asking, "To do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've said your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other no."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to place trust in the <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official of official or official or type, is going to be uniform in every day.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give up the kind of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it was not a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe it was to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why do we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> fashion.
I think that surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they are trying to <unk> the good inherent judgment to actually trust something or something.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not the goal that I <unk>
I want to have more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I am <unk> of not trust in which it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who were getting their savings with the very rightly named Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, he says, yes, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
So what it is about doing is doing a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that in order to make a trial, we are forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if you find a person who is competent in <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not relevant. We couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest guys, but they didn't get them in them to take a letter to the post, because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very confident that you can do certain things, but I see that they would take their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If you look like this, I still haven't got <unk>
But that's what we are <unk> to tell us before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to judge.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of professional institutions, officials and so forth, that make us easier for us to judge their reliability.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
And I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes more time to make the administrative sound that I would go to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we would argue that the accountability system is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the <unk> tests actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> as we say.
All of you may be familiar with similar examples.
They were going to do all of that, for the target.
I believe that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you stop being worthy of trust and encouraged by people who are safe and if we try to determine whether other people, officials or political officials are trustworthy.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple action, <unk> what doesn't do it properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> to the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
Can we rebuild the trustworthiness.
We can do it if they are two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately is signature because they give us the <unk> other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> by all people, all the time.
But you also have to bring them to make sure that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is a day, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can return them without going to give them a explanations for.
I take them back and get it back the money, or they change them because of the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become most vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not very difficult to <unk>
What people rely on is the relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers have come to us by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone <unk> more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the glass thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
So I started imagining how to <unk>
First created this tool that gets closer into digital space so that when the strong <unk> against the screen, its body physical body will die.
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool break the barriers.
But the two hands remain still on the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the <unk> <unk>
In the divide of <unk> <unk> of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital <unk>
<unk> a transparent Norden bombsight to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the space of 3D space, get the pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in the real space, <unk> it's as easy as grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and point out lines or words with the virtual coordinate sensor that there are below every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we were going into the digital world.
And if we reverse the papers and we make digital information come to us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and returned to the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk>
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understand the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make them be physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my <unk> Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, this one single physical pixel center.
This quantum imam is behaving as a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> the gravity and controlling the movement through a combination of quantum levitation and <unk> <unk> <unk>
And by programming the object, we release it from the restrictions of time and space, which means that human movements, can be able to go back and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality of the times that we want.
Students can use it as a tool for understanding complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike the monitors or the textbooks, this is an actual experience and palpable that you can touch and feel.
But what's most fascinating to change the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities every day.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something but begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to <unk> from our world.
So we started the talk today about a barrier, but if we suppressed that barrier, the only edge that remains our imagination.
Thank you.
I was thrilled to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to return to a school for athletes to athletes the payments.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution -- they believed that there was only an effective way to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
Whatever I would like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer to be an opening opera singer, though.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
And so I wrote to the director of the school and the news of a radio show.
But any adult gave him the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew he was too much more to train.
My dream would never be <unk>
I would argue that during the rest of my life a second class was the only thing that I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me wanted to <unk> OK.
Let's go to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in 1995, and what were the first books to do here?
The ones that were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda to <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a theme for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and much better than you <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture also led to my reading habit <unk>
It makes a lot of perspectives.
For example, the beginning of this map seemed to me out of place because this is what students in China will learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are up to research fields like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers an deepest understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why wouldn't it also do it in real life?
So I started reading books.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and duty.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Instead of losing in translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books brought me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to be feeling alone or powerless again.
Having a <unk> dream is really not nothing compared to what many other people have had.
I've come to believe that it is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams, of where the dreams comes from, where your happiness comes from.
A <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always have the <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology, at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named Alex.
Alex entered the first session using jeans and a third <unk> came up on the couch of my office took off the shoes and told me I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class had a <unk> as a first client.
And I was a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> became easy to just move your head while we had the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> saying, Alex, and so I looked at it, she was right.
You start to work afterwards, you get home later, it has children later, until death happens later.
And for <unk> like Alex and I had time to have time.
But soon after, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about her life.
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming out with guys under his category, he would get dressed up with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it gets <unk> with the next.
Also, the best time to work in marriage is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after they were <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a break.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to the age of <unk> <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're incredible.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take away the dream -- I want to see. It's okay. All the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be at 35 years.
This means that eight out of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give their life to their life will have happened to be 30 and <unk>
<unk> people -- you don't panic.
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we had.
We know that more than half of the Americans are married, and they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last phase of growth in its <unk> and it will be <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change from yourself, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than in any other moment of life, and we know that the female fertility goes to the 28, and things become complicated at the <unk>
<unk> are the time to take care of your body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and ordinary life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence of <unk>
Journalists are <unk> names to the <unk> like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said that to get big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole it to that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing happens.
And then every few days, intelligent, interesting things like you or your children come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship I'm not just killing the time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before 30, all being right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are by <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better grades on the day that I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around 30, the music turned into the music and all of them began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one I'm going to get stop, so I sometimes think that I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk>
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds kind of extreme -- but they don't get rid of the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure to the <unk> and so many of you start a career, to pick a city and choose a mate, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are some research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything once to the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
<unk> tells you you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I <unk>
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about what it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work in art or entertainment, but we still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, he was living with a boyfriend, who showed more than ambition.
And in spite of living a very hard <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then he would raise herself to say, "You don't choose his family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got her head on his legs and <unk> over the entire hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning with his many contacts, but then he was seeing the empty space that follows after the words -- "In <unk> -- please call me <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have an accident.
Who is going to take care of if I was <unk>
At that time, it took a lot of work to resist and I can't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his chance.
I had learned so much since I worked with Alex like I just sit as a decade of Emma went on.
So, over the next few weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that <unk> from that crisis of identity and <unk> capital.
For identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: It's an identity of identity generates capital capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, of that <unk> of that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> the <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that I shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration, right?
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that would explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds -- just as you know who you know what you know what you know about, how do you think about, how do you work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out almost always comes from their closest circle.
The new things come from what they're called weak ties.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the form of <unk> to this group.
Half of the jobs that were created would never be <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is how you get a job that was not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For last, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma soon <unk> his family, when he has a partner and it is their own family.
I said to Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before they <unk> and that means being so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it work or kill time with anybody who pulls them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a roommate in a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That offer of work gave me a reason to leave the boyfriend, who live in.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married one man who chose <unk>
I took his new career, love his new family, and I send a letter that said, "Now the spaces of contacts are not enough.
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are like aircraft that go out from the airport from Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in his trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years, or even on the next generation.
Here's my idea worth of spreading to all the <unk> who heard of.
It's as simple as what I learned to talk to Alex.
This is what I now have the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma all <unk> The <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get the capital of identity, using their weak ties.
They won't be defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to graduate students in the public schools in New York City.
And as any teacher, she <unk> testing and tests.
They give them tasks.
When I work back, I will increase grades.
What struck me the attention was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance, did not have scores of <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going to be doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was so convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and in life it depends on much more than the ability to learn in a quick and that easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what we are going to do, and we try to predict the military training and who is <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and tried to predict what children were going to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in neighborhoods really difficult -- what teachers will still be teaching for the end of the year and <unk> who will be the most effective at improving the results of the learning results of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, wondering what these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
Who is going to make more money?
In all these different contexts, we came up with a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health, not the I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long term.
<unk> is having a resistance.
<unk> is embracing your future future, day after day, not only for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career.
A few years ago, I started studying social schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my questionnaires of determination and then waited for over a year to see those who were <unk>
And it turns out that the children with more determination had significantly greater chance of <unk> even when the <unk> in every aspect that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the previous tests, even the security results that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not just in West Point, or at the National <unk> of <unk> in which it matters <unk> it's also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little the science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you use determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids a robust job <unk>
How do I keep it all over the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I do know is that talent is not <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, which is commonly related to or is even proportional to proportional to the measurements of talent.
Up until now, the best idea I've ever heard about developing determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and growing up in response to challenge, they are much more prone to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth growth is a big idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, we have to be willing to fail, <unk> to start all of the new lessons with them.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But to a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great <unk> China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break up this <unk> so that whatever I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes in every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic education.
The first 200 will allow them to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read signals of traffic regeneration signals -- to understand the basic idea of pages or the newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you may even be possible until it is <unk>
You get a mouths.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I were shouting at <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
I call sweeping these eight characters.
These are building blocks so they create many more characters.
A person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are <unk>
If a person reach their arms, this person is saying <unk> this is a big person.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, which is a <unk> --  <unk> to remember, because a speaker was quite an idiot.
Do you remember the <unk>
Two fires together, it becomes very hot.
Three fires together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door, put a table inside the front door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth on your door, asking questions.
<unk> played with someone at home?
This person is coming up hidden from one door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters are building other 32.
So with every small effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred <unk> which is the same thing that you learn is a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the <unk> we start creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So one sun alongside the beginning, we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> to their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the diaspora has become out.
A mouth that tells you where you go out is an exit.
This is a slide to remind you that I have to stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician, of Oz together.
The film was taken through his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave her a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic wand to me.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children into a kind of complex <unk> of childhood fantasy show.
But the magician, of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal guy and a young <unk> <unk> a girl dressed as a <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician, the magician, do today, the magician would say, <unk> are the salvation of Oz like the prophecy.
There are magical shoes to defeat the <unk> generated by the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician, of Oz is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I did about Star Wars my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a child.
Just three years old.
It was not invited because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had been <unk>  So she was so slid in the room and he was impressed like a mom with her <unk> in behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be the value issues, perseverance and <unk>
I would have the sense that Luke get an army to <unk> to <unk>
<unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How did he win his movie?
We do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up to <unk> OK? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much malaria force -- force in movies for our kids, and so little on the path of brick <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how children react to this stimulus.
I know by experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give it the proper framework that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first <unk> I really hoped that the chance of the movie, right?
My search is over, I have a <unk>
Why are they still standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on <unk> the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There's a lot of exceptions, and defend the Disney princess at any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they, guys, they're not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend them against the <unk> but don't necessarily show kids how to defend from the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, so real and lovely like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times is still coming up in classic <unk> each of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has done a movie from a <unk>
It's pretty good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies about the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not going to be <unk> but maybe today we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book and in the middle of the '80s, recorded a conversation that had had a friend on the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that have to be <unk> In the movie, there's more of a female character that has <unk>
So you have to get the <unk>
These women talk to each other in the movie?
Their conversations are about more apart from the boy than you like it?  Right? Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in film that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good <unk> film, <unk>
Right? <unk> from <unk> success -- an idea of consensus that is a Hollywood Hollywood film.
<unk> is not the test of <unk>
And I don't think I <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden in the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go back in the numbers.
In 2011, in the 100 movies more popular, how many of them think they have <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage of the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a larger number than this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted ever in their life.
I don't think it's the <unk> of mass entertainment.
I don't believe that movies for children have something to do with that.
I also don't think that music videos or pornography are closely looking, but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What's <unk>
What do you don't get to <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this statistic statistic and we want to be <unk>
We have tools that we have tools like <unk> <unk> and we expect that to be <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their own power.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily the parents.
I think we have to show our children who are a new definition of <unk>
The definition of manhood is radically changing.
You've probably read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk> home.
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star Star Star Star Star <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to try to reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories to tell me to my <unk> Go and struggle and more stories where their job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, she was living in Maine and one of the things that I liked was looking for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was encouraged by <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me to <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 mile long, along the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up the size of cities.
This is really what led me to using satellite imagery.
To try and make a map of the past, I knew it had to do another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see using the infrared use.
This is a place in the eastern Coast of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in the naked eye seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process using false color, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing are the actual chemical changes in the landscape of the <unk> materials and the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used the satellite data to find an ancient city, called <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place stands in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings than the <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge plain.
This area is huge. It's about <unk> by <unk>
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find that that would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes and using baseball.
So we use <unk> data to make a map of place, very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this very slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists doing works of <unk> you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the sample of showing in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation as well.
On the bottom, five meters down, under a thick thick layer, we find a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundreds of years that date back the Middle Empire of the exact same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs and <unk> <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> workshop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewels of the Middle Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence from a jewelry jewelry shop which shows that what has been there, it was a very important city.
We still haven't found <unk> here, but <unk> the place in the near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire of the Middle Empire -- I was probably written in <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
Now share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
And the ideas really started in 1984 B.C. C. B.C. in a lost city not for a long time and found out from the top.
It certainly puts the search for sea in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the gate, to the material that's made.
Now I took a group of <unk> <unk>
They're competing in a <unk> race and go into the direction of their <unk>
I need to see this <unk>
They're <unk> they are <unk> they're <unk>
They collide up against the door of his house.
There are bike bike around everywhere, flying around their side, rays from the wheels that end up in the front of the door, <unk> the line.
<unk> in the hall, or what is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
He's waving with your hand.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that is talking about.
You can feel your blue graffiti.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you can smell that it's about to go into the mouth.
They go on a side and go into your living room.
In the room, and I use most of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing about his <unk> <unk> singing <unk> A <unk> More <unk>
Now let's go back to the kitchen.
The ground has been covered with a yellow brick path, and from the oven coming to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest which is conducted every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> of <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages ladies and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, <unk> <unk> just once.
We were looking at the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
It took whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and he has one of the best <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realize that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained to do these miraculous acts of memory using old old techniques, invented two thousand years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that I used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that the medieval <unk> used to memorize books <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no ear of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and I <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English English guy, and he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> live in national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
So you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
And I ended up spending most of the year next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what its potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
It was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And in the back, I read a number of treaties on memory writing something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> memory <unk> and destructive was not one thing as rare as it might look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they've also changed us.
We have changed the culturally <unk> and I would say that they have changed us as well.
As we have no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where people are still passionate about by this idea of such a memory and <unk> memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there is such a way in the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University College in London invited a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it that they have brains in some ways, or some of the different <unk> of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They are more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the subjects of the subjects of control with them with the <unk>
When they put them in a MRI MRI machine, they <unk> their brains as it <unk> numbers, faces and <unk> forms of <unk> they found that in the memory champions we found parts of the brain, different parts of the brain.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves space and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament from the competitive <unk> is managing as an armed race where each year comes to someone with a new way to remember more things, and then the rest of the competitors should get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
It's an hour. Yes.
And while there is a large number of ways to remember things on these competitions, absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the end it reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It shows up with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox -- he says by the following: I say to two people who remember the same word, I'm saying to you, there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there is a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell me that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> which is <unk>
The person who was told that their name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that their job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that is weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, actually, doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They were fine when they come back home to work.
You probably get some <unk>
And when I <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this was two and two years ago, in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story goes like this: There was a poet called <unk> who went to a <unk>
They had been hired as a entertainment, because before before, if I wanted to give a very good party, it didn't take a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up foot, <unk> his poem of memory, and he <unk> and it was <unk> and it was so soon in the <unk> <unk>
<unk> all of us.
But it wasn't only killed all of them, but it shattered the bodies.
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
And so you couldn't get the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only survivor, in the rubble, and he closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I was sitting every single <unk>
I took the family of my hand <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> in that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or <unk> or instructions word for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If I told you to tell me the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to do it very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you told them to say who I was sitting on the horse on your lobby, you would be able to <unk>
And the idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of its mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember. The more crazy -- and the more crazy things, <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the picture, more <unk> will be.
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it the same way that I would have done it -- if they would have done it for 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote that you want to tell.
And then in the kitchen, and the fourth topic that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how the speakers are <unk> <unk> their <unk> not word for word, which is going to confuse it, typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his palazzo of memory.
I saw this was simply fascinating, and I got into that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring event.
Really, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets broken down the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
There are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
And so I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I saw the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old <unk> school <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was entertaining.
I would never have waited for him to hear it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it is really about doing is getting more and more and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of security pole with tape -- leaving only two <unk> because distraction is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same competition that he had covered a year before. He had the idea that you could log in, in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course it's cute can you <unk> <unk> and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just beautiful tricks.
Because these are based on basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> from <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift donated but it's not the case.
<unk> <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focused deeply.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they do <unk>
It makes a kind of deep processing, a kind of complete attention that most of them is not <unk> around there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things get <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today is what I <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what our short <unk> existence is in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, and we will be so <unk> that we don't even have to go into process and process <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capacities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person to remember remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover it in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so let's just take a place in <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old and lived there at home my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom for a child.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there they all spent the time watching television -- so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, and I all looked at me, and every time I went back, and I was wrapped up in a towel -- everybody looked at me.
And I was like this.
He was <unk> not and hated it.
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
That's right.
These feelings, those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or of those of those connections, emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
So 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think about it because you're based on a building built half two years ago.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection to the ways that we built our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build museum museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
You see, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time, and it's very complicated.
The people that we <unk> and the governments, they always have fear of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> has this round thing, columns brick brick -- which leave you <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values of ownership -- the <unk> values -- the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, got another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works as the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects who are constantly driving new technologies, new <unk> new solutions to the current forms of life.
We went to <unk> and we took it so much, that we get away from the people.
All black, this is us, you think we feel very good, but we're dead because we have no choice.
We have to go to the other side and go back to connect with those symbols.
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we start to experience about it, we can swing the rear of the back and over and over and over and over again.
Well, it was 30 years ago from the '70s.
Architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It's about the concrete.
So you can guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the rest of new in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know that like the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a bake a new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we made them <unk> that you can be <unk> <unk> made out of glass.
The shapes were <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, and we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic fantasies <unk>
Those fantasies could be the <unk> to the French or the <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we mixed memories from other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and begin to swing the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols we <unk> now we have new <unk> techniques, for computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that would be used against other forms.
This is <unk> and <unk> and it's <unk> You are totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum going back in the opposite direction.
But then something happened to happen.
In 1997, the building was opened.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when the academic and public and public <unk> agreed to agree about a building.
The New York Times journal, this building of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao increased by two and a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, and Los Angeles, in Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these forms, wild and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media went down around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes meant and <unk>
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
The same thing did the major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and <unk>
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennium, which has another star.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to move through all of the architecture, digital media started increasing the speed of information consumption.
Imagine, for example, how you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
The transport is <unk> you can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology can be seen in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, all of us are photographers in architecture, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't have a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings, before I know that that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we found buildings like this.
<unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That will never come back to happen. Because we're on the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the <unk> of communication, it starts to swing faster and faster, until you get to be on both extremes almost in <unk> and it was actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional load of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly like the done, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to come and shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a means of communication, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that you made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet <unk> the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell them that there is no unique response to what it might be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experiment.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words and beautiful drawings and complicated, and you're no longer an <unk> audience, who doesn't embrace anything you haven't seen before.
Architects can listen, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
That means that the phrase <unk> from one style to another, is obviously irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different to the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick based on ideas of what I should be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the shapes that are going to make.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a garage of parking lot in Miami Beach, Florida, it can be either serving for a sport or to <unk> or even one can marry you at night.
This means that three architects can dream on the East New York City in New York City, and raising half a million dollars of the joined community around that cause, no one customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make buildings more and more friendly buildings.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not in the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings not only reflect our society, but they shape the most competitive spaces, the local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the <unk> step in the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it does this great way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that the most likes to do is look at the mirror.
She really loves his picture.
It's laughing and <unk> and it gives itself those kisses big and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this, and my mom tells me I used to do it, and it made me think, "When do you do this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, he just wants to be liked and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a bit confused because, though his mom tells him all the time that she's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you that it's ugly.
Among what his mom tells you and what his friends, or school colleagues say, don't know who to believe.
So a video of her, it publishes it on YouTube, and he calls others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Okay, so far, he has gotten more than 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it's not even worth thinking about them.
We talk about a healthy and ordinary teenager, which receives these answers in one of the stages of their more emotionally emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it getting to do this?
Well, the teenagers today almost never are alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we have been so connected, in a continuous way, so young as young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that are going on with that is <unk>
This environment, that is always connected -- it's attached to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that are in.
There's no divide between a online life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what's not.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what you really have to be <unk>
What is the biggest thing in life in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a <unk> context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are cover from the age of girls now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is an routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people compares with young people.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> of the sport, and the singers, <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capacities.
Six out of 10 girls would rather do something because they think they don't see beautiful enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings and as <unk> to society and the labor development field.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in <unk> <unk> <unk> in the classroom <unk> because they don't want to call the attention for their physical direction.
One in five are not attending at all during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the rainy season. And if you don't think that you see good enough, specifically if you don't think you're smart enough, you get a note less to the average of your fellow who you don't care about that in the appearance.
And this phenomenon is widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it comes regardless of what actually weigh these young people.
So to make it very well of course, we're talking about as you see you, not what you're really like.
The low self-worth over his body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with time, they do less physical <unk> they eat less fruit and vegetables, participate in more healthy diet that can take them to a food disorder that they can bring them into a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around you, and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all over this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like drug alcohol and drug alcohol and drugs, <unk> aesthetics, aesthetic relationships -- and without protection and damage damage.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in one day where they don't feel safe in the way you see them.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that <unk>
<unk> this potential is in interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> The first is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is there are a lot of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that our children follow not only will have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key <unk> The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial points for anyone willing to provide a education in your body self-esteem that works.
It's a fundamental education, but address this problem requires each of us to take charge on the issue and be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
Just challenging the current status of how women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell with the input, our politicians in <unk> hair or the size of its <unk> or the size of its <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judging people for what they are, not as you can see.
We can start by doing it by doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we publish in our social networks.
We can inspire people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask: When was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to change our culture, so that our kids grow to valuing their own person, valuing their individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
by making a difference in the real world, let's make them be those who come out of the big screen, because just we will create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never being <unk> of being who are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who who have you in mind?
Her <unk>
Her <unk>
Her <unk>
Her <unk> <unk>
It could be just the woman who is two seats away from a distance. What would it mean for her if it was liberated from that voice <unk> in his interior, that he would love him not to have long legs -- more skinny, a <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were going to take this and give her potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is helping us all.
But let's go to our children the truth.
And the way that you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
I encourage the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And we put together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a age of age today, becoming safe to become safe change agents of themselves in the same morning.
So let's do it.
The five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Women's Defense League <unk>
<unk> was initially naive, but being prisoner by other minor charges, in the company of others, started planning attacks to about 12 icons in New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans were driven by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't be <unk>
Later on, he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, as he was an engineer who was a <unk> an American mother, teacher school teacher who had the two made for me for giving me happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims, even most Muslims come to know.
And for experience I saw that when people take time for <unk> it doesn't require a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in every human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who were <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think that we have to use all the possible means for everybody to live like them.
A few months before arrest he sat with me and explained to me that in the last week, he and some friends, had been going to training on Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When my father touched me, my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point to about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot at the little orange light on the goal and to surprise you, especially of mine, especially my whole goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned to the other and in Arabic, said, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a child.
All of all, the comment made a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they thought to them as funny.
You see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a van loaded with 700 kilos of explosives in the northern tower of the North World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and put them to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times. That instability during my childhood, wasn't allowed to make a lot of friendships.
Every time I started feeling comfortable about somebody who was time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always a new face of the class that was often the victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new of the <unk> quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent on house reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have social skills, so saying <unk> to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I <unk> opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way was during the presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program I participated in the National <unk> <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> on the subject of juvenile violence, such as I had been <unk> almost all of my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the convention, I found that one of the kids who had done friendship, was Jewish people.
I took several days to go out to the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and I felt very proud of having been able to defeat the barrier that all life had been made me believe that he was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer work in Bush <unk> a park in <unk>
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
The whole life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay <unk> were bad <unk>
I wish I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics I had seen in life.
Having been a child, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people -- exactly the way I would have to be treated.
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how to be homosexual but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All at night, Jon Stewart would be <unk> honest about my <unk> and I helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he turned my shape figure on a moment where I was desperately <unk>
In occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that an Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that holding my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hatred inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself on a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to take the violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better path. That even though I would lie to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get me to <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism, and by their loved ones, the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
For the victims of the terrorism victims, against those <unk> acts like rejection to the actions of my father.
With this <unk> I show you here as proof that violence is not inherent at any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all --  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Right now, there's a film that is projects in your minds.
It's an incredible film <unk>
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound that you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> flavor and texture.
Do you feel your body, your pain, your <unk>
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that project into your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your conscious thought.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you and you and you.
There is nothing to get more directly.
At least I know that I have an awareness of it.
I don't have certain that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason for living.
If you weren't conscious, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have to get to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
<unk> that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
<unk> by nature is an objective of science.
<unk> by nature is subjective <unk>
So you can never have a science of consciousness.
Because in most of the 20th century, <unk> that vision.
The psychology is studying <unk> behavior -- neuroscience is studying the brain -- but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few science jobs about consciousness.
It was 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the science work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years, was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in great work that was introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or to feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations anymore.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience is giving some questions that we want to explain your consciousness. The questions about what you do certain areas of the brain and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to the <unk>
In fact, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Well it doesn't address the real central mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal film <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emergent phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how we operate the <unk> how the <unk> work are <unk> and <unk> the living organisms and all of these are questions about the operating works.
So that could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a technological phenomenon -- how do we talk about, how we talk about, how we do all are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions of behavior are between the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it is that all behavior is accompanied by an out-of-body experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm, of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, it doesn't really have a lot to say.
I am a heart of my heart.
I want to have a scientific theory of <unk> which is going to work for a long time, hit me against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I got to the conclusion that that was not working for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a bunch of wonderful explanations -- we get used to this; the physics explains chemistry, chemistry.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is sort of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't even know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that <unk> <unk> before being able to deal with the awareness of a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, he has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such a hard problem of consciousness.
This whole idea of the subjective subjective film includes sort of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what we have to do, is to explain the functions to the brain behaviors -- and this is how everything you need to explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of absolute consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying than <unk>
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as bricks of the universe, the space and the mass.
<unk> fundamental laws than <unk> as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything else.
On the contrary, they look like fundamental and there is the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, mathematicians discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space -- and -- mass, mass laws, laws of Newton. And I applied the core rate as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas that are coming up space, time, mass, load, then a question of logic, have to be <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental and a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the path for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts of space, the time, the mass, the biological processes.
physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can get them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans -- the dogs, the dogs, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when you think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no, no.
But the thinking is that perhaps photons can have some element of crude feeling, subjective feeling of consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think as crazy?
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental like space, and time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum of nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful form of finding fundamental laws of thinking about thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing.
<unk> of <unk> complex as in a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> very simple information, simple awareness.
Something really exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it <unk> in scientific methods.
It has an mathematical measure of integration of information, which calls <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And you know, <unk> has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of information integration information, as significant as significant as significant as much of an important awareness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller -- but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
It actually creates a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality of the reality behind it.
Like Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From vision vision, the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not in the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right in the center.
So this vision -- I think, vision has the potential to detect our relationship with nature, and it can have social consequences and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that was consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think that we thought about this, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information <unk> she has a complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, there are some serious ethical problems about the ethics of the development of smart computers and the ethics <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the absolute consciousness -- the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or at a local level, an integrated group as the audience at a TED Talk, right now, we have a collective consciousness -- an internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question that has to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually safer in the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental idea, than the second, that it's universal.
The vision poses many questions, many challenges, like, how these bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right path to a serious awareness.
If not, well, that's probably the hardest problem about science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve at night in the morning.
But I think we finally will figure that out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village all Victoria.
He had a very normal profile -- a low carbon profile.
I went to school, I joined my friends, I joined my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very beautiful, but there is a sovereign problem.
She's actually not accomplished anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know that. What <unk>
But they were right.
I didn't do anything extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching me in a high school of <unk> as only about 20 minutes in the classroom 11 of the <unk> studies, a kid lifted up my hand and said, "Hey, when you give your <unk>
And I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about <unk> law for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When the people in the wheelchair, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And that's when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration.
And we don't. It's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, individuals with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there for <unk>
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you, right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you were lying in relation to disability.
Yes, we have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> by a capital <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something wrong and doesn't make you remarkable.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or is this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one of the girl with no hands in drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which is what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the term <unk> <unk> because we would give a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we would give the men in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, by very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that guy.
But if you're that person?
I've lost account of the number of times that they've been tackled by <unk> to express that they believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was kind of like me to get up in the morning and remember my own name --  And this is <unk>
These images, those images that are attached to the people with disability to benefit from people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something difficult.
It would make some things.
But the things that we have is not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was calling it to the social model of disability, which tells us that we are more disabled, because of society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm so <unk> with him.
And the things I need to do, and I have learned to get the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those photos as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So this is really fair to get in the way that we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people tell us, "You are a source of <unk> it tells you as a compliment.
And I know why that happens.
It's because of the lie, because we have sold this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> <unk> and you think, "Oh God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> from other people with disability in all the time.
However, I don't know that I'm so lucky that I do.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to upload the cell phone battery on the <unk>
Great.
We learn from force and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that would be <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that you have sold about the disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of the stairs has never done it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a television screen will not make the <unk> <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude will convert all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't be considered nothing to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low to the people with disability that we are passionate about getting away from the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value people's innate achievement with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a 11 year-old boy at a high school in Melbourne is not a bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think to know about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to look at <unk> reality and professional <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think actually <unk> think of <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> hands in air, but <unk> reality is not fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google Glass.
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is being a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would relate to your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is running through the game field to 160 <unk> the blood hitting your ears.
We can know that it feels like a <unk> man <unk> we were trying to <unk> them with all of your being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So let's get some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of <unk> practices, because the idea of the emerging technology is an emerging rising to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
Just a few moments.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have noticed that the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from Washington University.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be their favorite players and ask me on YouTube and <unk> "You can see from the angle of a field of field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go to the next level?
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that you probably know about.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, sorry.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
CK: That's the experience of a man on a rollercoaster <unk> by his life.
What is going to be the experience of a fan when you were <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of fan.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> throwing the ball into the bottom of the network?
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they were <unk> the <unk> sales for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when the <unk> <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
They always use technology to gain.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a quick primer on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> they put a <unk> to their <unk> in order to play it faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> of the field and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to your group and you see their next little move in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on. You won't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or you would have the strategy.
They just come out the field and react.
And the coaches want it, because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose the games, they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way of playing the game.
How would you do here?
Well, a very simple choice would be a camera in every single corner of the stadium having a view from the high of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
You have the bad <unk>
This will be good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop it for <unk>
It will be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that it's the <unk>
And they took the ball and <unk>
You get to a open receptor -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left-hand side of your bombsight will tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> you know, you don't know it, but the system of <unk> will <unk>
It goes to the protection.
Another <unk> you tell you that there's a open <unk>
It will be <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, though, the receptor sees in your bombsight an area of grass that lights and it can modify the race.
He <unk> catching the <unk> runs and <unk>
<unk> public and fans have followed you move it from every single angle.
This is something to create massive excitement in the game.
I'm going to do a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as bread and circus, like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth for.
It generates billions of revenues a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show you how bad their actions are from the perspective of the <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay person in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives to be <unk>
How much is it also for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, <unk> reality comes close.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face is always, as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I recently got <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years old -- I spent the southern tip of <unk> County, which includes the <unk> bridge, <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is the global view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean -- and its inspiring architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The New Yorker bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer chief head of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is almost a test of <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people think that travel between the two towers will take you to another dimension, this bridge has become <unk> as such, as each of it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used to do suicide.
After one of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact is breaking the bones, some of which we have vital organs.
Most people die in the impact.
The people who don't normally get caught in the water and then <unk>
I don't think that those who are <unk> this suicide approach will notice the death of the death that you <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches away parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people have to take care of their life.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the darkest time, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this photo last year while this young man was talking about an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we succeeded that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the 22 <unk> last year when he gets a call from a possible bomber <unk> sitting in the cord near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, he looked to Jason talking to a official of the <unk> bridge.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I'd flown up here two times before New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked ourselves if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology -- <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she went out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This guy and clever and clever kid in New Jersey had just got to take away the life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had read it.
<unk> supply is affecting a lot of people.
I ask them these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody would be loved outside a suicide member of it.
What do you say?
What does it say?
In my experience, not just to talk, but you have to listen to.
Listening to understand.
Don't go <unk> or tell you the person you know how to feel, because you probably don't know it.
It's just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask them the question is, <unk> in similar situations have thought to end up life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of you can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believing that things are terrible and never going to <unk> -- believe that there's nothing that you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the 19 of January, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with his permission and his blessing that I read I read.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you with a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party.
It never got there.
I called the police <unk> and the <unk> like disappeared -- that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house, and I was reported that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real infectious disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge, and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man when I mean hope and value.
On March 11, of 2005, I wrote a call from radio for a possible subject on the sidewalk sidewalk near the northern tower near the north.
I looked at my motorcycle <unk> and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he immediately crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and the next half I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided that day to come back over that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came to him, I read it.
This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did he have to <unk> and give you the hope and life another <unk>
And you know what told me?
He said, "You <unk>
She stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from my mother and Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing <unk> <unk> events, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I read Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We give God for you.
<unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she write, <unk> When I visited the General Bay Hospital that night, you will <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I had to do it.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and of its depression with the hope that her story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather killed himself with poison.
That act, despite finishing up his own pain, offered to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain out.
Usually this is actually achieved by three things: <unk> drug or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents I've been directly involved in -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
And during that time, I was holding my hand at three times.
At the end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It was absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few who have jumped on the bridge and lived and that can talk about it, that one percent or <unk> most of those people have said that the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge not only connects to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or a bridge that we do, is something that everybody and every one of us should be able to get to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There is help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but you see what you are, and you know what you are, and you know what you're going to do in that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone at all.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> my inner truth with me inside.
By complicated reasons, the ones that I'm going to refer to later, when I look at this picture, I think we got it down, we got it <unk>
But last October, I discovered that I'm just starting.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our religion, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of skin or because of the beliefs that surround us.
These are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even, ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called <unk>
This is mine.
They signed up as <unk> at birth because of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I would always wear this shirt in my head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in <unk>
I said, "Mom, my hair is a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I never taught myself to share my story, not because I thought that I'm a bad thing, but why the world is all about the world of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, my dad and a family who take me like I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines of the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something is <unk> This is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> <unk> competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you participated in the competition of <unk>
He told me that if I was <unk> she was <unk> from <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in <unk> I won in <unk> and he was a third <unk> between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly I was in the world of <unk> <unk>
Not many people can say that their first job was from beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when <unk> in remote provinces of <unk>
But more important than that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mother who had moved to San Francisco, and he called me and told me that he passed my request from the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you get to the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all that I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I would put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when she was <unk> in Thailand to 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand perform the most sophisticated surgeries sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time, in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before they changed the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license, and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document is to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears looked <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living was living his truth, but that <unk> finally put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November, we do a global vigil by <unk> Day.
I'm on this scenario thanks to a long story of people who are <unk> and they stood up with injustice.
These are speakers, P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just me.
I want to do the best to help the others to live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that one day there's no more <unk> than 20 of <unk>
My most profound truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. First of all, thank you for all my <unk>
My parents from supporting my parents especially, my family, who is very strong.
And I remember all the times I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that her parents couldn't take it, and I took the phone and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- others don't. It's just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all gave a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table that sometimes sometimes that task -- not block, and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> And this is a conversation that we should have with parents, <unk>
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should have understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice <unk> Thank you.
In many and the tribal and tribal societies, parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when his efforts were <unk> his efforts in 2011, when I was <unk> the National School <unk> became very famous -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I am his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of gender and violence and exploitation.
You see, in the industrialized societies right from the beginning, when I was born a child, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome and no because of his mother.
The neighborhood comes up, day his <unk> to the mother, no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was very excited about having a little girl.
When you give birth to the first child, the first child, it gets lost.
When you give birth to the second daughter, <unk> and hope for a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, he feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just the mother mother, but the daughter just <unk> when it grows, it suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays at home and school from her siblings.
Up to the age of 12 years, in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move around the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes back in your teens, when it was 13 years old, you signed up from his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes called the honor of his father and his brothers and his brothers and his family and his family, and if we were to <unk> the code of that <unk> that might even kill.
And it's interesting that this <unk> <unk> of course is not only affecting the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of his sisters in behalf of the course of honor.
And there's a rule more of the <unk> societies called <unk>
This is supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It is supposed to be silent and embrace the decisions of his father and their mother decisions and even if they don't want it.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you put it with an old man -- it has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk> from <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to embrace it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle goes on and on.
And I was like, <unk> and sisters, when I was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I <unk> I thought about her name, and was fascinated with an <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half years old and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half
You might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yes, I must <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the tribal societies, in tribal societies, it's a big event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
<unk> to school means that has gone into the world of dreams and the aspirations where they can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them were able to go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when I was going to look at the form of Green <unk> and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen was the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or their daughters, and I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
And I got to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The <unk> going to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
I went to my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, and more rights to women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was a lethal for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all of the economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have about those people that kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got up by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the picture of the BBC, was offered her same for New York documentaries and talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and nine in October 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I loved him to my wife -- <unk> <unk> for what happened to my daughter to your <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play for the cause of the truth, for the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was born, I was in the hospital and she had severe severe pains, because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was going on from my wife's face.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and my face.
I'm going to be good at me. Please don't stop.
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
And they put together brothers and sisters, and we learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when you don't have his task.
They fight with your brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's in my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I don't tell you what I did.
I read what I didn't.
I didn't cut its wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and, since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion to me.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google <unk> <unk> where I've had a <unk> my <unk> the Google <unk> <unk> but all the work I'm talking about here today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
You're still the same as smart or not?
If you don't, you can go back to <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter but it was the sticky part of the center of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, die in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations of the combinations of <unk> and try to make it for life.
More than once I've saved it for me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try to get the dose of it, because there really is no longer a clear map that I say in <unk>
I began to test with different <unk> and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the dose would be broken down, my sense of who was me, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months -- I tried doses and typical chemicals for a man of <unk> and I was amazed by looking at how my thinking were.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several types like this, or maybe some versions of the <unk>
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> so much <unk> to fix a problem that had the front, and it was just not going to happen that way.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience I gave myself a new appreciation of men and about what they have to do -- since then I carry better with men.
What I tried to do to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, I was to recover my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I would think about almost always in pictures, and that became my key point of key reference, how I can with those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if we were <unk> <unk> new ideas and recreating that we were <unk>
This class is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things in similar ways.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who come up with this idea, and there's a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I managed to find the point right now, and I have lots of great <unk> mental <unk> they really are very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to get these mental images, of my mind to the computer screen.
You can imagine what would happen if a theater director was able to use their imagination only to lead the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty doing this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're quite close to this with two recent experiments that have done for two groups that in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, image imaging -- to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person looking at an image.
The column in the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual, as you were going, seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created by <unk> the contents of the central column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with a lot of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between looking at an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is a <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube videos while they were putting their brains to create a large pool of reactions to the video sequences in the video.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as long as they were <unk> a new <unk>
The computer using the brain brain of the scan of the scan of the scan of it to show what seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're pretty close to doing it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you imagine that same picture, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the largest brain scan systems that are available today, and its resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we do that?
There are many techniques to do it.
One is to open up the skull and put electrodes into it.
I don't offer that one.
A lot of these are proposing new techniques from projection through images, even I have to deal with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we have to ask ourselves, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with bigger magnets -- but this point, the most <unk> magnets only offer small improvements in resolution -- not increases by thousands of as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger magnets -- let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort on MRI is to make really big <unk> right?
And yet, most of the recent advances in <unk> of brilliant and brilliant solutions and <unk> in <unk> and <unk> of FM -- FM radio systems in MRI systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field they were able to include magnetic magnetic patterns structured -- to the radio frequencies.
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing patterns, we can actually increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split up in layers our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood of the blood <unk> but the hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity is going to be directly. This is sleep.
We will be able to put our ideas directly into digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking.
You thought the Internet is something big.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's disease and similar diseases.
We have few more options than opening up this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it's going to take a lot more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
Their closet is probably telling some person for the first time you love, or tell somebody who is pregnant, or tell somebody who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have in life in life.
Everything is a hard conversation, and even though our subjects can vary <unk> the experience of being lived and having come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was sitting there, I had to go through various stages of the <unk> <unk> <unk> I don't know, my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> like a <unk>
And I will be <unk> that by the <unk> of my <unk> <unk> and I had my head <unk> I would ask for a little <unk> "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there'd be a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I put my jaw a little bit longer, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look his son.
But I would not say anything, and we were going <unk>
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, he was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a kid or a <unk>
A family silence but this time was ready to go into the female issues at the table.  He had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> of Gloria <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," <unk> that <unk>
And so I took my eyes up, and I went down and my backs and my backs was a four year-old girl with a pink dress, looking at me, which is not a challenge for a <unk> type, just a girl with a question: "You're a boy or <unk>
And so I took a long breath, and I put myself out of <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something troubling.
I have the short hair like a kid, and I saw clothes, but I'm a girl, and I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a <unk> <unk>
Because I am more of the kind of a <unk> <unk> girl.
And that girl looked at me <unk> by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he's got a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all the whole thing. "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation ever ever to ever ever have ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and I know, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But in the dark, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how it feels like living in a closet.
This is how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> will give you 100 reasons for why getting out of my closet was harder than getting out of their own, but this is the <unk> It's not <unk>
The difficult thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has <unk> <unk> is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I story is harder than saying to your five-year-old son you're going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, only there is the hard.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult to be difficult for somebody to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we have to just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side offers the door.
But I'm here to tell you, that no matter what your walls are, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It was not necessarily the militant lesbian to fight any child in four years and come into the coffee.
I was frozen because of the fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my nearest guy, gay, and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole friends, full strangers I have spent my entire life trying to do it, and now the world was turning around purpose.
It was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill you.
One of my farms of grenade more memorable was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of them knew that I was gay, and when I do my <unk> lady, in my black dress and black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and eventually I went to one where my friends were in my parents, people who knew me years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women cried <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the gay story has begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite <unk> Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but waiting to show your support, to let me know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is using <unk> <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, as they have all the Scud <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, they <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing to do.
This is how hard conversations do not be my strong point.
Ask anybody with the ones that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what you mean to come out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the cafe had no armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> others have to know that we do suffer.
Number two: Be directly <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that these are gay, you know.
If they say their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will keep the hope that that might change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It will never be touched by that.
And some of you can go out safe wounded -- so they have done, but never really sorry about what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find it in a dark closet <unk> <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very yourself, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If we look at the story of how the intelligence has been seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computer pioneered like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we would have a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms behind intelligence.
So let me take a step.
First, with a thought experiment.
Imagine that you are from a <unk> race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can look at the Earth and have incredibly long lives, so you can look at the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know about this, that it doesn't have any concept on Earth's intelligence -- would be forced to develop a physics theory that would explain how, to some point in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet <unk> let us do it.
And that's why I claim this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of the intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, I believe, to one of the one underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately adjusted to the development of intelligence, and in particular, to development of universal states that will address the diversity of future possible.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of the robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to do complex tasks.
And so taking all these different themes and <unk> together, I asked them for several years ago: There is a mechanism underlying the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just an intelligence for intelligence.
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence I have ever seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a force, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open choice, with a <unk> force, with the diversity of potential accessible, Yeah, even an impending future time.
In a nutshell, we don't like to get <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the choices open.
And so having in account this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that make more mess, or <unk> during their life should have to be more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection to <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence is an <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple evidence of animal intelligence, play games, of humans, and even earn money -- <unk> actions, all that would have been asked to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a foot of foot without <unk> here we see <unk> automatically put a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it a goal.
He simply decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for robotic robotics and human care technology.
This ability to use tools will have applications of intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate by pulling opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable at a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a <unk> game against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where our friends are constantly constantly getting together and it keeps the network right there.
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organize the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering success and using the Panama Canal to expand its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense problems, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of negotiation negotiation by increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability for risk management will have broad applications in finance, and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the use of the use of the <unk> the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if we were making smart machines, there would be <unk>
The machines went against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, have had all the concept of the rebellion of <unk> in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all right, that the urge to take control of all the possible future is a fundamental principle than the intelligence that general intelligence can actually arise directly from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for goal.
And I often ask me, how do we look for targets learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go to the descendants of them to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, it is this: intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the constraints in its own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
And although in the last few years, we've extended our knowledge of how the Earth fits into the context of the universe.
The Kepler is discovered thousands of possible planets that orbit around other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope, which measures the faint <unk> of stars when planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light coming to us.
The data gathered around Kepler shows the sizes of the planets besides each of them and their stem star.
Together, this helps us to understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the land planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their <unk>
Instead, this gives you clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the fastest recorded.
<unk> and ice ice that have been with us for millennia now are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused on a global scale has rapidly outperformed our ability to disrupt its course.
But I'm not a weather scientist and the weather, no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone really interested in finding life in the universe I can tell you that the more I'm looking for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better: our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a world potentially livable -- this is a mission like <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to the Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> tracks their surface in search of the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> as the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Local companies now offer not only short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images -- <unk> remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas that are <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the equatorial areas of our planet that are still in <unk> places that are actually <unk> in comparison to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and <unk> places, the air is cool and filled with oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement about the colonization of Mars and other planets go with a big and sad <unk> the implication of some that Mars is to save us to save us from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly <unk> the Earth.
And so I like to like the <unk> exploration, I'm deep disagreement with this idea.
There are many good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there to safeguard humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party of truth will have place in the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration, and the global preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understand, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> <unk>
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile areas of the earth, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi started asking that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence for alien life to now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the Fermi paradox is that when the civilizations become advanced enough to consider to continue to live between the stars, lose the notion of the important things that we can protect this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization -- we will save ourselves from ourselves, but the <unk> exploration, and <unk> exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I was going to get my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that was on the dining table of the dining room, where I had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and all of them were closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> might take a long time to get to it, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I walked out of my passport and <unk>
<unk> expensive, but they're sure not more expensive than a <unk> to half night, so I thought, that despite the circumstances, I was very happy.
I'm a profession, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that the heart rate increases your adrenaline levels and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to counter counter in the airport, I realized that I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that could do, systems that could put in your place, which I would argue that bad things happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later my thoughts would not be <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little bit embarrassed I talked about the window, and I had forgotten my passport. And Danny shared shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> like <unk> <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you might go wrong, then try to figure out what can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with <unk>
In the house, it will be a place for the things that you lose easily.
This sounds of common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to address the location of the important things, where the places are, where the fish, where the fish, where the fish are <unk> and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that lets the <unk> find your nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and still they could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that mechanism very evolved in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose your car keys, reading goggles and <unk>
So in the house, you put a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular drawer in your passport.
For your reading, a <unk> in particular.
If you take a place and you are <unk> with it your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a picture of your credit cards for your credit cards -- license, <unk> <unk> by mail in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> it can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain is released out?
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there is perhaps not more <unk> that when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, that we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a dear to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this was <unk> as a <unk> for all making medical decisions, and in fact to make financial decisions and social decisions and any kind of decision that we need to take the one that would benefit from the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart attack, brain injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> medications in the world today, even you are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you should do then, a statistic that you have to ask for that most doctors don't want to talk about, and companies pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have to have surgery on any medical procedure before you help one person.
And it needs to be thinking about what kind of statistic <unk> is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a doctor, and if it's somebody's guilt -- it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood the mechanisms that are <unk>
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think is it?
How many people have to take it before they help one person?
300.
This is based on the research of the cynics researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a heart attack, stroke brain or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, 1 likelihood at 300 to my <unk>
Why do not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is, you know, <unk> of the <unk> effects, Yes?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include hard things that include muscle pain and <unk> pain, but now they think, <unk> percent is not very likely to happen to me, still taking the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress don't think clearly.
So think of how to do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? One person has killed him five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug that will help you the drug.
I'm not saying that they should or not take the <unk>
I just say that you must have this conversation with his doctor.
The medical ethic is required, it's part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have access to these kinds of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take your risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to deal is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the older men in the United States of 50, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number necessary to deal with is <unk>
This is 49 surgeries for a person who's helped.
And the side effects in that case, are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of before the questions that you can argue that we would raise the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a lot of a lot of times, you want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that could have much pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and loved ones.
You can change of opinion in the heat of the moment, but unless you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that time is that you turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face 2 Face is a predator, you don't need the immune system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism on those things, it's not very fast.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the logical thinking of rational thinking, as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to be able to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail every time.
And the idea is to think about the future how those <unk> might be to put systems in the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things to happen in the first place.
I went to the night of <unk> in <unk> when I went back from my journey, my contractor gave me a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the gate of entry in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I have lots of letters that I haven't <unk> and lots of messages I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing from a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may never be <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the 1950s, and over the time, mixed with local signals, and developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that the sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really is in my mind every day.
As a fellow <unk> who lives in a world of sound, is as if I lived in a foreign country -- following blindly <unk> their rules and <unk> rules and norms.
So how do I understand it?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example ...
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you don't get in the <unk>
This is all called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound label more than the average person doing it.
I'm a <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
Let's go ahead and go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign of <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, I do whatever it is with my thumb and it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic nursing there.
Before this time, I had worked as <unk>
In this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and while I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At the time, the sound was the trend and that called me <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to tell me more of the art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like that.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it not only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound ownership and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all I had taught me in terms of the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was struck by the amount of support and care that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> was a <unk>
And sound is so powerful that it could be brought to me and my artistic work, or I could be <unk>
I chose to be <unk>
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I had no voice at all.
So I have to work with people that can support me equally and become my voice.
And so I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> your voices, I am able to keep a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan out of a very high interest rate.
If you wouldn't continue with this practice, I feel that I could be <unk> at <unk> and not having any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same one can say from a concept in <unk>
The two are very highly <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the meaning as well as the sounds of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor on the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide in many different different <unk>
If you map a very different <unk> for every finger while you play the piano, like the facial expression, the <unk> movement -- the speed, the hand of your hand and like this, as the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you were <unk> only one button at a time.
However, <unk> is more like a chord, you need the 10 fingers in order to express a concept or an idea of <unk>
If only one key key, the chord would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing about music in terms of and volume.
In <unk> by using these different <unk> parameters you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> sign.
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all the day."
If you will, and you <unk> the visually speed, you see as a piece of music.
The whole day.
I feel that the same can be said by <unk> <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, let's go back again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times per <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk>
Look at <unk> right here, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands.
Now we're going to do it both in my head like my chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a <unk> is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please return back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
You look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest but they convey very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, automatically has no social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> You don't have to hear about music.
<unk> is a rich trove of treasure.
I would like to start to open up your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, <unk>
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you take you all everything, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> involves responsibility.
But my imagination led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence, or a bubble of ignorance I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from the appalling truth.
When I was getting older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean up each other.
The country, now I am an adult and I teach citizenship and invention in <unk> school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of crap.
So as good citizens, we cleaned the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but now more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we have been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect these little bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and also it's very risky to use those enormous boats as well.
So together with my students, with ages of six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We have transformed our little classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that the kids very <unk> they can also participate in.
And I will tell you, the kids who manipulate electrical tools feel neat and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave the imagination from my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to engage them in something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting plastic pieces just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the children get a lot of a lot with robots.
And then we started quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast at the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned light up and moving web cameras in Styrofoam, and we put it back into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
It was going to take this last step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else would do it even more.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my problem. But my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
Do you see the news <unk> <unk> the Internet, and it was <unk> with this image: one.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning an oil spill, just using the hands of <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that you drink is the water in which the water <unk> where the water live in.
You can also see that the water is brown the mud and the oil is also brown and when all of you <unk> it's very hard to see what about water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> which can spread through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what is in the water.
So we looked at this prototype with a sensor and we sent Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I can read a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit more far, maybe address a more difficult problem, and also close to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and maybe remember, in 2011, there was an devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear station close to water.
And today, according to the <unk> of 300 tons are still leaking from nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the whole Pacific has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it has a certain thing, is blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and research independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night you go to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It may seem that they didn't take the seriously, seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all of their life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent real-time data from <unk> and water to simulate the rain.
So with this we were able to notice that the radioactive powder will be taken from the peak of the mountain to the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this set of a civil expedition, the nearest <unk> of nuclear power to date.
We got up to a half to a mile of nuclear, and with the aid aid of the zone we were collecting sediments from the sea bed.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been so exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even begun trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became so much small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the larger space dedicated to social impact and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with metal metal, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically, you can actually build almost all of us there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become true with the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
So for example.
Or can we help the mobility of the elderly population transforming their standard wheelchair <unk> in new <unk> vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children is lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, scientists, creators, we have to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made from thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other one string of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic thing.
One is placed in the environment, the other one believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one.
Miguel <unk> said that when he looked at the marble marble -- he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was only a <unk> tool.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smaller units of life, the cells, we took all the information it takes for every cell to work and to make it out.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have <unk> a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects like <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material <unk> in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pores here.
The skins of the back is warmer with little <unk>
You act mostly like <unk> the other thing as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that varies its functionality through variation.
Here's a divided screen that represents my vision of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect at working between the <unk> and the gene, between the assembly and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and <unk> between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right analysis, and synthesis, it shows you at two screens after me.
My work, in its simplest level, it's about bringing these two visions of the world, moving away from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why could it not be possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare time, where they have four disciplines that offer designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and my hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools and tools through scales, large scale, like this robotic arm with a 24 meters diameter with an additive basis, that someday not very far <unk> buildings, and graphic <unk> made of genetically <unk> <unk>
So here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every aperture is size to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion fashion fashion show in Paris with <unk> van <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing <unk> we printed this layer and 3D <unk> without seams going to show you more objects like that.
This helmet is <unk> <unk> materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner scanner there.
That designers have access to this <unk> <unk> and the instruments in order to design products that will happen, not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair to the <unk> comfortable chair and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this pattern of surface surface -- it becomes <unk>
We put this surface of 44 different properties -- which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, attached to the points of pressure in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, its functionality not by adding the addition of another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously <unk>
But it's nature <unk>
There's no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them was stuck and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends it to the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> tree.
So for that first <unk> tree there would be no difference between the <unk> twigs, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was <unk>
Instead, the land made the trees growing trees with twigs, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made out of it.
I often ask myself, "What would design if the objects were done in a single piece?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we were looking for the material <unk> the kind of tree material <unk> with fruits, and we found it.
The second <unk> the <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced each year by organisms.
We think that if we could tune their <unk> we could generate structures that are <unk> in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> legal <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of <unk> from dark, hard and <unk> to the soft, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the march into the march and create these structures made of a only half material.
When the pieces are ready, it gets them to dry it to find a natural way to the contact with the air.
So why do we continue to design with <unk>
The air bubbles that were just a byproduct of the process of printing were used to contain microorganisms <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet 3.5 billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT -- the genetically designed bacteria to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make its transition out of <unk> to mesh and <unk> and if it spread even more to windows.
A <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best two: for <unk> objects in the sea, <unk> <unk> life and placed in the ground, help us grow a tree.
And the match for our next exploration of the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we have to master the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the board <unk> we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made out of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- and we will be <unk> new basic criteria inside very small channels.
This is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, it was <unk> two <unk>
The first is the <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human brain.
It turns out the light into sugar, the other it takes sugar and produces useful biofuels to the built environment.
But these two things: they don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never been <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship on a piece of clothes.
Think of that as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to hold these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the nasal tract that is going to help which flow these bacteria and that they would take their function off.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to <unk>
If we wanted more photosynthesis, you get more transparent channels anymore.
This system <unk> <unk> when you reach from one end to another, it goes 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our little <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> channels bright channels in your clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are late in fashion -- only half is <unk>
What if design, the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increases inanimate matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin -- <unk> the damaged tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do it, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home within which it was <unk>
<unk> is not about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers in each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm is first on the environment, create a tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, is <unk>
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we glue a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with active sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the <unk>
However, when I put the silk worm on a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that he <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts -- different <unk> and we've discovered that the composition, <unk> structure was transmitted directly by the environment.
And often the silk worms are often going to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that we saw these <unk> we can shape raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot.
We knew the silk worms to the darkest areas of silk and <unk> so we use a solar path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays out of light and heat down the silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
And so we wanted to do a <unk> silk farm on the line.
And after four weeks, four weeks, they were prepared to deal with us.
We put them carefully in the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much shortest is it.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the grand integrity, and he was right.
The biological silk of silk <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion and our integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks or three weeks, I mean, <unk> silk worms -- <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk is using a robotic arm, the other full gaps.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us -- to form a ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which takes us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by the first time, which demands from us, for the first time, that we're taking care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered what you want to be from <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
They can stick with your toes.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question "What do you want to be from <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be about <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had any interest, but I had <unk>
In school, I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and making web websites, and I was playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And generally I like to try and try and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to give it out.
But then I was struck by something else, something completely different, and I get stuck with it, and I let me absorb and I feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all my other passions passions, and I would go to <unk>
Another reason that made me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for <unk> at all.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or to be dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to let me back then.
And I would look at themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they did it, they learned from culture.
So we ask first, "What do you want to be about <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what I was going to do at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make cute answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk>
So this question we get over and over again as we go from different ways, <unk> <unk> to students in high school are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, what do you want to be about <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of the first before the sleep <unk>
Why?
While this question inspires kids to dream about what they might be, it's not inspired by dreaming of everything they might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adults are going to be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk> --  and he is <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> and <unk> and creative teacher.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose from.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real calling that each one of us has something to spend over their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and to dedicate your life to it.
But if you are someone who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different themes that wake up your curiosity and many different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling there is something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Is it a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for that.
It could help you on three different parts: multiple <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms to be used by the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
It will take any term that you like or your own <unk>
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or distress that you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there is huge strengths that are in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualizing data, travels mathematics and design, when they found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates inspired <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
Hence the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all of his background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower is learning fast.
When we <unk> our <unk> we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being lucky, because in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk>
As a young woman <unk> an amazing capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before becoming a writer, <unk> was <unk>
He had to learn the finest sales mechanics when they started their practices, and this skill helps to write compelling launches for the editors.
<unk> is <unk> to be a waste of time to get to what you would give even if you end up at the end of it.
Is that knowledge in a completely different field, so you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. That is the ability to transform it into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, any TED designer designer, sometimes choosing a Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes it appears to appear apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take different roles depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to flourish in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the market, which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're pushed to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging the <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, we have right now, and we need creative creative thinkers to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep in and put our own ideas, and the <unk> provides a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that we are connected to how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> largely are encouraging them to be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there is one thing that you take out of this talk, I hope that it is this: <unk> your inner <unk> whatever it is.
If you're a heart specialist then <unk> all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many ways passions.
Keep his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring takes a more authentic life and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, we have the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> they brought her to a psychiatric psychiatric one.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> her until it unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, he had done a look and found weird plates and <unk> in the brain of <unk> in a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If you were going to have been living today, we couldn't give her more help than the <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has gone very long.
They have been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the <unk> many treatments for breast cancer, <unk> for the <unk> and a lot more.
But recently, it has been progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now is affecting 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live until 85 years or more, chances of Alzheimer's will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you spend your years to happen to Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or to be wanted with Alzheimer's.
In America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their costs -- an increase in five times by 2050, as the generation of the generation of <unk> <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively short to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death from all around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you cannot be able to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more than every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's research in spite of the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to one more fundamental cause, lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but all the world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few <unk> years, all of all, even, scientists, Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have a picture of a picture of a brain aged healthy in comparison with a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to making a severe loss of memory and mental skills, damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's -- significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
Over a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds as an origami.
There are places in paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots are left on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and identifying what will block is complex, as a bomb.
You know, a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that it happens, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in the most part, the wires have shrunk and waited for the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, <unk> engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that blocked specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when I test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick with each other inside them, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so that it grows that hope, from overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's all about you.
We have to convince ourselves that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we fix it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> on governments, pharmaceutical industry and <unk>
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit today to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking to them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
And I would take this article in the New York Times <unk> in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The paper is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and from my own experience to try to test myself a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: -- two strangers will become 36 and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking about four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you put to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> that <unk> these are increasingly personal <unk>
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> <unk> to your partner what you like of him or her, I know very frank about this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a really big detail I really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the time I was able to test this study, with someone who I knew not particularly well -- I didn't expect to <unk>
But we were <unk> and   And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column love.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you might probably wonder, keep it together.
And the reason I think was <unk> this is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before I was published the paper I was <unk>
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had encouraged me to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog input can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and that was usually only from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would be probably a few thousand of the views.
And that came up with a very good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as I was given, I had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday night, and already Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I've already called the "Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million <unk> and I was like, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing that <unk> about own experience, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  -- that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they were doing first the question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox in my email with the phrase: <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came out immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where your <unk> is.
And I immediately put it red.
I think this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international journal you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the breadth of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for Saint <unk> who included the experiences of readers when I study the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all of this attention was to be very close to my own relationship.
I said not to every request that they both made a public emergence together.
He was interviews, from television interviews, and he refused the orders of pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> icons of the process of <unk> and a range of that I didn't feel at all of the <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if it was really <unk> or so if it was able to produce <unk> love, not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and I felt, most of all, that people signed the wrong question.
How do you know if you were to go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study, and there, the researcher goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I sought sought to foster interpersonal approach, between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants felt closer to doing so, several studies, they were also used protocol protocol as well as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it among members of the police and the community, and they used it among people of the <unk> political policy.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, it was cited in this article, but unfortunately it never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a small liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> I tried the study and didn't work.
He seemed to be fascinated by it.
And I said, "You want to say that you would fall out of the person who is <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but became better friends?
<unk> that they did get better better than testing the <unk>
<unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking at when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really hard separation here.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was virtually my whole adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I took on the science.
And I did all that I could find on the science of romantic love, and I hoped that that could be a certain way to <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just took the book that I wrote in -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was built with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and used as I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demanding what we <unk>
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably than reasonably me.
What I'm looking for for love is a <unk> not just about being <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but that I'm going to continue to be <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people wondered when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story said about 36 questions about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very scary story, because fall in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we are very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that says, still remain together?
And his content with an answer of yes or No.
So more than a question, would submit that we ask more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who to deserve your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love when things get together, and how do you know when to cut and make it out.
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they are a good beginning to have a <unk> conversation about what to love someone.
So if you want the short version of my own relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known time and I was using a study designed to create romantic love, and we still keep up with each other, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I didn't think of everything that we had.
I didn't look at how many times we would have both to make that decision, and how many times will it have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded to 36 questions, have chosen to love someone so generous, and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the U.S.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe really.
And what you want, and what maybe spend my life for is that that myth is true.
I want to be very happy implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper that I actually didn't make.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose somebody, and the hope that he would also love to love, and it's scary but that is the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a couple <unk> and in a certain way I got a <unk> of the forest.
<unk> in New York City a while.  Something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and he <unk> a dollar, and a dollar, and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some of these strange <unk> or a few people, you would find this box about 500 years later and figure out how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it is grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At one point he was in <unk> <unk> like going to <unk> and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a <unk> for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> I went into the style Agnes Martin, I covered the resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of the bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, something else happened in some way it seemed to grow the size of size, as if it was that we would touch the text with a <unk>
So I did it? I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding with electronic elements, and weird bottles that were going to find out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to go and tell me and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow up, drawing the same as you do about a dead body, a crime scene.
And I took out the objects and I created my own <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> that you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and strange creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I was interested in the human form of human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I got <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the layers of glass, similar to the drawing on a window, and then in another window, and another window, and it had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional three-dimensional species.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work with something very big -- that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by great measure in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a bit ahead of their time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
<unk> <unk> pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double <unk> so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of <unk> to this <unk> mesh <unk> where they were <unk>
This is where creatures of animals are headed by <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird God tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there's all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a bit of a narrative.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then when you go on the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird, it spits out of this <unk>
It also has a cubic 300 feet long, a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn on fire on a <unk>
I don't know why that happened that.
Things that go there, you know.
Their tail ends up in a <unk> of <unk> made from terrorists from 1986.
They have <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were to be a baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> in time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each is an archive of our culture, through media and material or material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they come together, they divide it.
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years.
Each one is basically a <unk> <unk> which weighs 1.3 billion pounds of a human in their inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> Is it the chest, you can <unk> the <unk>
I'm going to show you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it has, you have a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't take it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body party in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange rock.
There's a little forest scene inside the chest <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician a musician, a radio, a museum, a school, a book that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
It takes the box and all of the people in it strikes each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you're living on.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of religion -- it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But in order for this pill to have against the pain, first goes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
Take a pill is the most effective and most effective system for any drug <unk>
The <unk> though, is that when you raise any drug to be <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take drugs that are <unk> these serve the amount of viruses in the blood, and will increase the cells of <unk> cells.
But they are also known for their side effects on its <unk> in its negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the current <unk> it becomes <unk> and worse still for the time that it takes to get to your destination, which is where it's more important to <unk>
These are regions of the body like the axillary nodes. the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily come into the blood of the patients that are <unk> to regulate drug drugs.
However, after the disruption of the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for life run by <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> making the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for wounds and diabetes surgery, they can be used for anything else, including shipping drug transportation.
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open up or drill extremely small holes, which opens and closed almost immediately cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best you ask yourself, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful laser beam on the cellular membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro technology, or on plate plates, but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can <unk>
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, goes to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug is released directly on the site of infection, while the laser is using new to keep cells open.
Well, this doesn't look very much like that.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researcher at <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups, not armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
And what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to better understand these agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to the confrontation of not violent.
I do a field work, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors and non-governmental actors.
For example, of the <unk> deals with 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and an actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any process of conflict <unk>
But how do we do that?
We need to know what they motivates these organizations.
We know a lot of the reasons why we were looking at how they do, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't exist.
The armed struggle and political policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We cannot understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide bombers against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than simply fire, to fire.
They're multitasking up.
<unk> a complex piece of communication or radio stations, radio channels, television, web web websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed magazine magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising <unk> but by using business -- for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals, they put in professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
Political groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn out by war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups to give us safety.
And unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price to the population.
But in general, to provide social services that means filling an empty gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 of the Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social job of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at those groups -- we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups participate in violent struggle and they give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated things are these organizations, less we can <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, running all of their <unk> collect the trash, and they run the system of <unk>
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world in states of nations without the state and hybrids and the weaker are states, like in the Middle East, more and more <unk> and they fill that gap the actors didn't government.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in a single military tools.
You know, <unk> that government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and to make peace.
If we understand better for groups -- we will understand better what incentives to foster the transition from violence to nonviolence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, people, military power can earn a few galaxies, but we don't give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these targets we need long-term investments to fill that vacuum vacuum in order to fill that vacuum vacuum that allowed these groups to flourish at the beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the <unk> label would be unfair to the <unk>
I'm <unk> but it's pretty bad.
And therefore I was <unk> as a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a piece of paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in the interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become something bigger.
Let me take one step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and that would be sex.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> who might be daunting.
It's going to be labeled as a feminist -- a taboo and ugly word.
I <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who asks too much, with high self-worth and dare to believe that it's equal to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
With time, as I grew up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, feminist, and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
Tell me the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> free from bullying or violence.
We have a right to use it to be easy and accessible to your contraceptives and services for us.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need for <unk> or doctrines to be <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There is more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to figure out our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, and much more.
We have to have in account these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm filled with contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I hear rap rap -- all volume.
Although the letter degrades women and offends me deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of the Yin yang -- the <unk> is incredible.
<unk> reality with your <unk> t-shirt reality.
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am completely <unk> by my musical thinking.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the <unk> tasks, but also killing insects -- and they also kill insects and <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from the fashion magazines and the beautiful things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies <unk> from the <unk> fairy tales that make reality.
Some of my crimes are <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it is his election, and I'm not who I am to judge.
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise his children, to <unk> that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women financially vulnerable when they were born.
So let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has been ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the color of color, and <unk> and <unk> for women, white women and high height.
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist feminist
It also happens by the following: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this trend of <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we're going to make the perfect difference.
When we were <unk> with a lot of fun from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I would be <unk> from that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and innovative leaders, they are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> because of fear that they mean that they label that label by fear not to be able to get real expectations for it.
Take a look at <unk> or like I call her, La <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist feminist feminist feminist feminist issue.
In the Video: Music <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this pop star and take the feminism star and make the women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical critics began very hard debates if I was going, it was or not really, really feminist.
<unk> their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection by <unk> because we're still fighting a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot of it.
We go so much beyond the sensible criticism and constructive to <unk> feminism from any woman, <unk> until it's nothing.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminism or more good, an feminism more <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We have to recognize our <unk> to give the action and be a little more <unk>
If I hear music -- I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy than happy providing a power supply.
These artists are not going to change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change actually affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify an worst choice.
But when the bad decisions are justify that it makes it harder for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
These are two little girls <unk> <unk> and <unk> and too brave. I want to grow in a world.
They are being told by the strong creatures they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice to be done as much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the canal when a television program is all about sexual violence against women as sport, and <unk> the <unk>
We can change radio radio when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when the movies are not treating women more than as <unk>
We can stop supporting the professional sports professionals where athletes treat their classmates as <unk> of <unk>
In any case, men, especially the white men who may say, "No, I'm not going to publish his magazine, participate in his project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate as a decision to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your garage or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but to engage in this kind of projects, we can also afford to be even more as well as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements is going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top of the people in the power and producers of film and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable change and meaningful change.
We can also affirm our courage and bravery up the good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, above all, because I <unk> my voice was stolen to me and feminism helped me to <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to address what happened.
And a few boys were <unk> when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
It was my voice, and after all, I wasn't going to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was focusing on a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what can measure.
Through writing and terrorism, I also found that if I was a little brave -- another woman I could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I argue the <unk> reality, that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad geek, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think about what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need about such a threat.
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had measles because I had to have visited <unk> or to be exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border to Canada, <unk> to more than 100 children in <unk>
And one of the things that this outbreak came out of this outbreak is that the measles that may be lousy for a child with an immune system is one of the most painful diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century ago, but many of the kids involved in the outbreak of <unk> didn't have been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, was not the article that sparked the argument about autism and vaccines <unk> and marked by being a fraud system by British Medical Medical
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines will pay in danger to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
<unk> and <unk> that I had heard of her believed to develop all of his professional life without seeing one case.
Over decades, the prevalence estimates they continued to have only three or four children per 10,000 <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
fundraising fundraising as <unk> <unk> routinely refer to autism as an epidemic as if it could catch another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people in the Centers for Disease Control what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic diagnosis, and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the criteria of diagnostic had to be <unk> why were they so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less to do with the slow progress and <unk> the science of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we come here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatry -- Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
They could have fun for hours by waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were prey to panic for <unk> as when they don't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
For the 1950s, as the major authority of the world in the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome while <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis was very <unk>
For example, <unk> to give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he gets rid of that he had become nine out of 10 children from other doctors to their office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child <unk> caused by cold and <unk>
These kids, he said, they've kept very carefully in a fridge that you didn't know.
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that you cluster together in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records in, he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad view of these skills, affirming things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents -- desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, turning it into invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist, thought that the theory of mothers -- <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a young girl like without support, without special education, no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
So to defend in the National Service, that they needed more resources for the young children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
<unk> a study of prevalence in the overall population.
I had a suburb in London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse in autism, because the reality of autism was much more <unk>
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination for astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the genealogy of <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in beautiful frames and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
Early on, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How no one had ever noticed these children before?
But then I found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the year next to the article of <unk> and then he would be <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but he avoided <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> <unk> German, and he was doing it for her.
The paper offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for children teaching children with sex differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music exercises with music, and the children followed their games on Sunday, the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as <unk> disabled and <unk> <unk> <unk> spaces over the course of all life.
Instead of treating the kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called her little teachers, and he went to help in the development methods that were especially suited for them.
<unk> Asperger's of autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of hope, and disability.
He believed that autism and people were common and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in biblical culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that <unk> the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late 1980s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a wide <unk>
These changes fell in a broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between us to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before he came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the first easy clinical trials were introduced to diagnose autism.
I wasn't supposed to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that it were, allowing people with autism and their families finally supported the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the rise of the <unk> a simple, powerful, powerful, credible story as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of prevention -- that one of the 68 children in the United States are on the spectrum, is right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, the autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that are the puzzles for solving the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's cut.
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
The autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still catching <unk> which believed that the <unk> for the most disruptive aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the boat from the <unk>
As it comes to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
