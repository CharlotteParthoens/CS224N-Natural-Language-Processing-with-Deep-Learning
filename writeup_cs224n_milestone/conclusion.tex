\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

So far we have seen that character-level word embeddings help improve the baseline model. As next step we plan to implement the Base Attentional Model (Section \ref{subsubsec:baseattentionalmodel}) and the RNN-Conv Contextual Embedding Model (Section \ref{subsubsec:rnnconvcontextualembeddingmodel})
