\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

For the final project of CS224n, we chose to do the default project. We also propose a slight variant of this problem as a strech goal (Section \ref{subsec:projectstrechgoals}) where we would like some feedback on the proposed idea.

The author is a SCPD student in a single person team. There are no external collaborators. We are looking forward to a mentor being assigned to us, since we have no particular mentor. We are are not sharing this project with any other class.
